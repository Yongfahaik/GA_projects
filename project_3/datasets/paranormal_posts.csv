My mother is a believer in the paranormal, and has told many stories over the years - from the shadow figure in her house to the apple-stealing boy at the supermarket. Whenever I’d go with her to look at another house (I had an unsteady upbringing; moved 9 times before I was 18, and viewed upward of 40 listings) she’d always talk to me about how I felt and what sort of *energy* was in the house.

As an adult I haven’t had a “concrete” paranormal *experience* of my own (as I child according to my mother’s stories I did) and I am truly neither total skeptic nor firm believer. I’m on that fence! But energy is something I feel very intuitively about, and am very conscious of.

According to my mother and her stories, energy in a house / room / place is connected to the paranormal and spiritual worlds.

I've never told anyone about this even though it happened when I was a teenager, some 40 years ago. My parents have long ago forgotten about it, but only knew a tiny bit of the story anyway. I was a teen in the 70's in a small town on the north shore of Lake Ontario. One day my buddies and I were cruising around looking for something to do. We decided to visit our friend Dean. While we were all crowded in his room he was telling us about making friends with a biker gang that used to exist in the area called ""Satan's Choice."" They were great bunch of guys, treated him well, etc. He had a necklace made by a guy who was now serving time for murder. It was a cross made of bent nails and wire and I thought it was cool looking and Dean offered it to me. That night I hung it on my bedpost.

I was sound asleep but dreamt that I woke up. I saw an old time Monk, with a hooded robe covering his face and a white rope belt around his waist simply walk through my closed door. Being a teenage boy I immediately said something like, ""I'm going to beat the sh#t out of you,"" and ""You picked the wrong house buddy!"" I tried to get out of bed but was tangled up in the blankets and the more I struggled the more tangled I became. He reached the side of my bed and lifted his head and his face was a skeleton. He reached out and wrapped his fingers around my neck - I could actually feel the cold bony fingers on my throat. Just then my right arm came loose and I came up off the bed and drove my fist into his face but...he disappeared. In an instant - vanished. I fell in a heap on the bedroom floor.

We used to have a big German Sheppard and it was making a commotion outside my bedroom door - weird half barking half growling noises. My dad burst through my bedroom door with a baseball bat in his hand. He had heard me shouting at the thing and thought someone had broken into the house. I slept the rest of the night on the floor with one arm around the dog and the next morning rode my bike to a nearby ravine and threw the necklace as far as I could.

Here's the weird part. Okay, weirder part. In 1993 I lived in Muskoka - about 2 hrs north of Toronto. I was killing time waiting for a bus to take me to the city and was flipping through the pages of a coffee table book in the library which was right next door to the bus station. I turned the page and saw a photograph of a apparition in an old English church. It was the same thing that came into my room. It took my breath away. I've had other high strangeness events happen but that one kind of stood out. Like I said, I've never told anyone, but for some reason felt like I needed to tell it here, now.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,939948,public,new,self,Weird Dream - Sort Of...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rsthwl/weird_dream_sort_of/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So the night it happened nothing new. Brushed my teeth, fed my dogs, shut my door, and went to bed. 
My room is basic, I have my desk at the foot of my bed, and a window on the opposite side of my room, facing my bed, the blinds closed so no light or shadows could be cast. 

With my alarm clock being on my desk, I could see it in my peripherals.

I woke up at exactly 1:38 AM, I still remember the time,

When I woke, I immediately noticed two things, 
A) I couldn't move, but I could still look around with my eyes,
B) A large shadow-esk figure was to my left in front of the window.

There were three main details I remember about this thing.
- Featureless, though I swear I saw beady, small red eyes, could be wrong on this tho.
- Tall, atleast 6 ft or more
- And this dark hat. (Kinda looked like an old bowlers hat.)

He kinda just stood there staring at me. Freaked me the **** out, but I couldn't do anything.

After a few minutes of panicking, I guess that's when in ""truly"" woke up, cause in the blink of an eye I could move, but when I turned to flick my light on, he was gone.




Now I know this sounds crazy, (and I probably am) but I told my doc, who I'm friends with, and he said it's probably from the stress I'm under at work, but that can't be it, I'm pretty decent with it rn.

This didn't feel like a normal dream or anything I've ever felt. Any answers would be much helpful.

Some quick research suggests this one paranormal entity I can't find the name of, but again, any comments or answers would be helpful as to wtf this was.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,939869,public,new,self,I need help understanding this dream or experience,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rsnzbn/i_need_help_understanding_this_dream_or_experience/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although I’ve had experiences I certainly lean towards being a non believer .

Okay so first story.. I was between the ages of 5/6, I didn’t even know what ghosts were at the time. I woke up in the middle of the night for reasons unbeknownst to me. I looked towards 2nd story bedroom window. To which I saw a shadowy figure sitting on my windowsill. I get up to check it out and I hear a voice saying something along the lines of ‘if you tell your mother I’m here I’ll kill you’. So I shit myself and run to my bed to hide under the covers. A couple minutes later I check to see if the man is still there and he is. This time I had the courage to run full speed to my mothers room and tell her. She came and checked it out and the man was gone. I thought maybe it was an intruder and it wasn’t till I brought up that memory years later to my mother I realised that it was maybe something paranormal.

Second story took place at a similar time up at my grandparents house. This place was seriously haunted according to my family (like unbelievable movie scene depictions of hauntings). My grandparents and I slept in the same room and I fell asleep at one point. I wake up to the sound of my grandmother shouting at someone. I look up and there’s an old woman with her arms crossed in front of the tv. My grandmother was used to it and she kept telling ‘Thelma’ (she named the ‘ghost’) to ‘fuck off’ in good old British fashion. Eventually ‘Thelma’ fucked off into mid air and I started catching up  on watching casualty.

The final story took place when I was 12 ish. My grandfather had passed away just a year prior and he was a man that loved scaring me. My mother and I were talking from opposite ends of the stairs, I was upstairs and she was down. I had a habit of dangling my leg over the stair bannister at the time. And while I was casually talking I hear someone go ‘tut tut tut’, the worst part is I felt the breath in the inner part of my ear. So I shit myself and ran downstairs at unfathomable speeds.

Today I would like to tell you about Hooty. About a month and a half ago, my dad went outside and found a little charm outside. This charm is a small worn metal owl with a worn out black string on it. 
It might not be weird to find random trinkets outside. But I live on a farm in the middle of nowhere. In Canada. This time of year, you can’t find the ground, let alone anything on it (other than snow) Especially when you live in the middle of nowhere. 
I didn’t think much of it, a little odd, but whatever. My dad asks, do you want it? Of course I do, it’s a cool looking trinket. The second I pick it up, I know something isn’t quite right. It just feels off. But I shrug it off. It’s a cool look owl thing. 
I’ve been keeping it in my work room next to a closet. In this closet is my furby. I’ve never had problems with this furby. Ever. About a week after having this, my furby would start talking at random times. It’s weird, but whatever. I ignore it. Now it plays for at least an hour everyday. Where it is, no one or nothing should be able to touch it.
After a while I decide to tell my mom about the occurrences. She tells me to get rid of it, she doesn’t want it in the house. She’s never been sceptical of the paranormal, just prefers to ignore it. 
Well I typically don’t leave my work room until after everyone has gone to bed. I usually have my lamps on by this time, but I’m terrified of the dark. So to turn off my lamps, I turn on my main light, turn the lamps off, and turn the main light off on my way out of the room. Then I close the door and turn my phone flashlight on and continue to my room which is on the other side of my living room. My mom wakes up in the middle of the night. The living room light is on, all the lights (lamps included) are all turned on in my work room to which the door is wide open. 
Now her bedroom door won’t stay closed. Like at all times of the day. It’s always open just a crack. Her door has always been heavy so it has a tendency of opening all the way if it is left open just a crack. 
Another thing, I went to the kitchen and grabbed a glass from the cabinet and placed it down on the counter. I filled it up with some juice, put the carton back in the fridge and turned back to my glass of juice. It burned my hand to touch it. The glass itself was scolding. The juice was still cold. 
On top of this, I keep having this very vivid dreams of someone leaning over me when I’m sleeping. Like what your parents would do to make sure you were actually sleeping and not just faking it.
I’m genuinely curious what I should do about this trinket. When I messaged a friend about it, they said they got an off feeling about the picture and their tv started going on the fritz as the picture loaded. Which I though was odd because when I took the photo my computer speakers glitched out. Nothing bad was happening before my mom told me to get rid of it. Just a quiet presence and the furby going off. I don’t feel threatened by the presence but my mom doesn’t like it or want it around. I’m not sure what to do with it.

Have you ever questioned why it exists? For the past 3 years I've devoutly followed a Christian path and I would like to share just a minor but quite out of the ordinary experience I had just a couple of weeks ago. As most of us do, I've struggled with addictions, which by the way have greatly eased since I started asking God for assistance. However when you choose to become conscious of sin and actively strive to be set free from it, life takes on a whole different meaning. You start to see things in a way you never thought actually existed. Live for a purpose that was previously beyond what you could imagine. Note that you must realize that sinful deeds are evil, and not merely a pleasurable addiction that wastes your time and energy. If you can't see why, then strive to find out, there's a reason why so many wise men speak against it. Even most atheists realize that it's bad.

Anyhow, one night I was tempted of a particular sin that I've fallen to in the past a bit more than I ought, despite having fought it with all my heart. This night I was really weighed by this temptation, and I had gone quite far away from it and I wasn't ready to pick it back up. But I was genuinely tempted. However, instead of acting on it I put my head down towards my pillow and decided in my heart that I don't want this, not for God, nor for myself, it's just not worth it. Suddenly after I made this decision my perception of reality suddenly shifted. It was as if suddenly I saw that which we regard as real, the visible and tangible material world to, be the ""illusion"", and that which we regard as illusion or subjective, the emotional world was the actual reality. I realized that it is because in this subjective world is where we make our decisions, we either strive to do what is right and good, or we strive to do what is wrong and dark. For example, we can give a gift either because we genuinely care about somebody, or because we only want to look good infront of others and get attention, or because we want something in return. Or we can commit a crime by accident, having retained completely pure heart, yet on the outside be regarded by others as an absolute criminal. In the emotional world it's the difference between light and dark, yet the matieral world reflects both of these scenarios as the same, or identical. That is why we can also appear so good in the world but yet on the inside be very evil people. Because morally speaking, it's not the full obejctive reality. 

Anyways, as I was laying there I started to realize the depth of our emotional darkness, without being affected by it, meaning, I was feeling fine. I started to realize that it stretches down infinitely deep. The depression and the darkness and the evil we see in our life is actually just the beginning to a pit that grows forever in darkness, death and agony. It has no end. As I started to be able to grasp the that the darkness was infinitely deep, from the very bottom of this pit, which in fact, according to this experience, is right here below us right now, though in a place where our eyes cannot see it, and our bodies may never touch it. I heard what can only be described as a terrifying roar. And it was tremendous in its nature, it was vast, it was absolutely immense. I have only heard sound that can even come close to resembling this from science fiction movies. It sent quakes to the depth of my mind and very soul. And it was super clear, I heard it with my ears, i felt it with my body. It had an emotional effect to it as well, it wasn't just a sound. I just felt that the roar came from a place of destruction and terror, it was death itself. Death was a living thing, and it is eager to destroy everything that is in existence, and it hates us, personally. Death isn't just phyiscal decay. It's something that begins way before the body is subdued, the death of the body is just an effect of what death is, but not the essence of death itself. I saw this. The Bible also speaks of death as something eternal and spiritual, rather than just a physical body ceasing to function. After this experience I really began to understand the depth of the Bible. The sound of this roar was indescribable, it really was as real, or even more real or ""ultimate"" than anything I've experienced in my life. I am absolutely 100% sure that this is the bottomless pit spoken of in the Book of Revelation, and that the roar came from the ancient dragon it speaks of. It's actually real, but hidden. I even tried asking and speaking; ""Hello? Can something hear me right now?"". I expected my voice to echo because of the strange place of vastness that I was in but my voice was just me in my room. It didn't reach the place or dimension this was all taking place in. Yet it was all in the same place. 

What I drew from this experience is that this place is present right here, right now, and it's more real than our comforting thoughts and ideas, hopes and dreams, material wealth, comforts and entertainments. Unfortunately, this reality will only become very very apparent for most of us after we experience physical death. Most of us assume that death is the end of everything. Many people who are agnostic or have some sense of that there might be something spiritual often think that it's after death that we choose where we go. That the tunnel with the light appears after death. The fact of the matter is that it is here that and now that we choose. So to lighten things up; there isn't just death, there's also life that continues for eternity. And all we have to do is humble ourselves enough to genuinely ask God to lead us into that light, and he will be faithful to do so. You can know this because life takes on a completely new brightness, and it proves itself through your actions. Spreading the Gospel really wasn't the point of this post but the message plays a major role in what I experienced, and the thoughts here are simply derived from this experience along with some others. I hope you can find this interesting or even insightful, even if you don't believe in God. If you wish to argue about religion please send me a PM instead of cluttering the reply section.

Tldr; Resisted a temptation of sin, and loudly and clearly heard the terrifying roar of a vast being down below, in a space I had never thought existed or payed attention to.

To mod: As I mentioned, this is NOT to spread my religion, and if it does, then good for whoever hears it. But it's a major factor to how I interpret my experience, that is why I've incorporated it fully in my description of the experience.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,939713,public,new,self,"Roars from the dragon below, the ancient serpent called the devil",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rsejjb/roars_from_the_dragon_below_the_ancient_serpent/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This came to mind a few years ago when I was fascinated by a rather infamous haunted painting known as ""The Anguished Man"" (side note, just thinking about that thing gave me chills). The long and short of this piece is the creator had painted it in his own blood then killed himself in front of the painting, where it has since been occupying an attic for the last several years. I had learned about the piece through (of all places) an old episode of Planet Dolan, and how supposedly it could bestow negative effects even from looking at still images of it or video.

Further study came up with a similar effect regarding one ""Robert"" the Doll, a well known haunted objected known for cursing or haunting anyone who takes a photo or video of it without asking the doll it's permission first. There is of course the painting of Ivan the Terrible after he murdered his son, which had such an impact at its debut someone attempted to destroy the painting because of the fear and madness it produced.

So my inquiry is this: how do you suppose these images are able to transfer the power/energy/will said to inhabit these kinds of objects through various media? And what's more, how long does that power remain? Say for example a fire destroys the museum where Robert the Doll is kept, destroying the artifact. Would any images that had been taken without the doll's prior permission still carry a negative effect? And what of sound clips said to have captured the voice of supposed negative entities? Does recording such negative power in a way preserve it, act as a conduit through which the malevolence can transfer and endure?

Like they were having a conversation. My bf woke up thinking I was on my phone, I wasn’t.  We both were trying to ignore it and get some sleep. As the night went on we heard crying in the other room, again we did our best to ignore it. As the morning came up, my bf asked me if touched his leg I didn’t. He said it felt like someone was playing the piano on his leg, he also felt like someone was standing behind him. He then told me how he heard this deep demonic voice that sounded like it was giving out commands. One of the commands was “kill him”.

However for those who are unfamiliar, here is brief description taken from Wikipedia.

&gt;In English folklore, **Black Shuck**, **Old Shuck**, **Old Shock** or simply **Shuck** is the name given to an East Anglian ghostly black dog which is said to roam the coastline and countryside of East Anglia, one of many ghostly black dogs recorded in folklore across the British Isles. Accounts of Black Shuck form part of the folklore of Norfolk, Suffolk, the Cambridgeshire fens and Essex, and descriptions of the creature's appearance and nature vary considerably; it is sometimes recorded as an omen of death, but, in other instances, is described as companionable.

Though I'm not here to tell you about this story, but in fact looking for those that have had any experience with Shuck, or if you might know of anyone that has.

I currently have an ongoing project about this folktale and I'm trying to include real-life encounters, so if you have, please reach out either commenting below or sending a direct message so that we can discuss and have a chat.

However, there's always been one incident from when I was between 3 to 4 years old that I remember vividly and can't quite explain.

We have a gigantic wardrobe with three parts; the middle door being a full mirror. It's older than me and my mom had it made after she got married. One evening specifically, my mom was in the living room while I was standing in front of the wardrobe in my bedroom. 

Instead of my upright reflection, I clearly remember watching myself sitting on a bed while talking to my mom who was folding clothes. She had nicer clothes than she usually does when she's at home, and was chatting with my reflection self really enthusiastically.

I wasn't at all creeped out, I just felt like I was watching T.V or something. After a while, my actual mum walked into the room wearing completely different clothes and I told her ""look we're in the mirror"". I might have phrased it differently but she didn't really pay attention and just responded with ""Uh huh that's nice honey.""

I've never had anything like that ever happen to me again which is why I've always remembered that incident really clearly. I saw some people on this sub talking about mirrors being portals to the other side or something but then why did I see myself and my mom?

I was trying to sleep the other night, the central heating went wrong and it was like summer so I threw the duvet off and lay naked on top of the bed sheets trying to cool down. 

I rolled onto my back and after a while felt a coldness moving up my legs, it stopped at my groin and kinda hung there for a while. I thought I was just feeling cold so ignored it. It went away and I was hot again. 

After a few minutes I noticed it again, it didn't stop at my groin this time but carried on and I felt the coldness move up my body to my genitals. And another coldness moving down my chest and tummy to my genitals. 

I was fully awake while this was happening but was too scared and confused to move. So just lay there and let it happen. 

The coldness on my genitals stayed there but was moving, I guess caressing me? After not very long of this I got an erection and that's when I got an overwhelming sense of calm and kindness that stopped me from feeling scared and confused. 

Then suddenly nothing. The coldness went away, but I still had an erection. I sat up and tried to collect myself a little and work out what happened.

She was in and out of psych wards, on a ton of medication, and quite frankly, life gave her a really bad hand to deal with. She was on 24/7 oxygen due to cancer, and really just had a lot of issues in her life.

My mom befriended her at a really dark time in her life, she didn't have much, so my mom and I helped out with food and money and whatever we really could. I wasn't necessarily close to the lady, but here's what happened.

About 2 weeks ago, she got into a fight with her son, causing him to attempt suicide. She was drunk at the moment and had to call the police to take him to the hospital.

They left her behind when they took him, and as soon as he was gone, she overdosed on sleeping tablets and insulin, and allegedly also drank bleach.

Cut forward about 4 days, her son wakes up and hears from family friends that his mom committed suicide. He doesn't have anyone, except us. 

The police refused to give him the keys to their house until he went to identify his mother's body at the morgue.

He asked me and my husband to go with him, and here's where it all started pretty much.

We went with him to the morgue, dealt with paperwork and all their issues, and eventually they let us go to the back to see her.

On a side note, this was my first ever time inside a morgue and let me just tell you, that smell is horrible. I never expected it to be that bad. Anyways.

They wheeled her out and we saw her, and I felt this extremely heavy weight on my chest.

I've always had a gift for seeing and communicating with the other side, and this was exactly that feeling. An overwhelming pressure that almost feels like it drains you when it's there. Almost like every single person laying there wanted me to hear them. This stopped as soon as we got in the car again.

Now, this week I've struggled staying asleep. I keep having bad dreams and feeling something watching me.

Our house is haunted, no doubt, but it feels like there is a new entity.

My husband woke up one night to go pee, and woke me up when he got up as well. He was really quiet and eventually told me he saw what he thought was a spirit, standing in front of one of the cupboards in the kitchen.

He told me initially he thought it was a person who broke in, but when he took a second look, they were gone. He also noted that he wasn't scared, but just startled.

About 2 days after that, I woke up to use the bathroom as well, and I saw the same exact figure, but in our room, and it was hunched over behind a chair. I also didn't feel scared or anything, and sorta just let it be. I did feel a bit uneasy when I went back to bed though.

But here's the thing. I don't know if it is my mom's friend, because the figure we both saw was entirely black. The only thing they really had in common was being extremely skinny.

I had ghost sightings in my room in college that I had suppressed up until tonight. If anybody else has genuinely seen ghosts, tread lightly with this story as this room traumatized me for years even after I moved out. Also apologies for how long this is, I don’t think I should spare details. TLDR at the bottom.

I started college in late august of 2012. My freshman dorm was my own room attached to a common room with three other bedrooms attached. I arrived 1 day before the rest of my roommates and was watching ghost hunters alone in the common room. Out of pure boredom I mimicked the hunters on the show and said out loud: “if there’s anybody else in this room knock on my door three times.” Immediately I hear three knocks - I freaked out of course, went for a walk and chalked it up to my mind playing tricks on me. As the first couple of months progressed weird things like this kept happening but I chose to ignore them to keep my own sanity.

1 of 2 main experiences I couldn’t ignore happened right before winter break in mid November. I was laying on my side in my bed sleepless (and sober) staring across my room. Out of the blue, I see two white orbs the size of baseballs appear in front of my dresser suspended in the air side by side. I was in a state of awe staring at them. All of a sudden they start circling each other in a dance progressively for about a minute before they merge and become one big orb and then start to fade away. I cannot remember how I reacted after they faded away.

After the orb occurrence, unexplainable activity became more of an everyday event. Every single night there was a scratching noise right by my door - it sounded like somebody scratching their arm but louder and it lasted all night. I would see and hear my door fling open in my peripheral vision, only to see it still closed once I turned my head. Electronics shutting off randomly and radio volume erratically increasing and decreasing. I learned to ignore these things once again to keep my sanity. I also told a few people including my suite mates but they would just laugh it off and thought I was looney. 

The second major event that I couldn’t ignore happened in the early spring 2013 - I never slept there again after this. Once again, laying on my side, sleepless but eyes closed this time trying to relax (around 2 AM). All of a sudden my phone lights up next to my bed and I opened my eyes to see no notifications. I immediately get an eerie feeling with chills down my spine and then hear my door handle jig. Next thing I see is a black but translucent figure of a little girl with pigtails come through my door on the other side of the room. She skips over to my bed, swipes at my phone as it’s still lit up, and skips away back through my door. My phone stayed in place next to my bed. I am in a state of complete shock at this point and my entire body is paralyzed in fear. Instantaneously, a tall figure of a man (at least 6ft) appears standing still next to my bed in my line of sight. He was no more than 2 feet away from my head. I was staring at the side of his body and he was facing the direction of the end of my bed. At first in slow motion, he starts running in place. He then starts moving his arms and legs progressively faster until his limbs are a blur. My heart is beating out of my chest as I’m realizing I need to nope the fuck out of there. As the man is still there I rip my covers off, grab my phone and sprint out of my room and go down the hall to my friends apartment. She was French - a big skeptic and always up late so I knew she would listen to my story. After I calm down, she convinces me to go back in the room because she thinks I’m bullshitting. We decide to sit down on my bed with all of the lights on so she can prove to me how delusional I am. Within seconds, a loud bang rattles against my wall as if somebody has thrown their body against the wall. We both jolt up and gtfo and from then on I slept on her couch. 

Fast forward to tonight, almost ten years later. I meet up with an old mutual friend of one of my suit mates and catch up with him over a beer. He would sometimes crash on our couch back in college when he was too tired to walk home. I bring up for the first time to him that I stopped sleeping in my room because it was haunted. His eyes widen and he tells me one night he slept in my bed because I wasn’t there and he was sick of the couch. He told me he didn’t believe in ghosts until this night and I asked him what he saw he said was there was two spirits he saw. My heart sinks and I start losing my breath from the memory of that room being brought up from suppressing it for so long. He described the same scratching noises and his phone not being able to charge. Then in the corner of the room appeared two figures of a tall man and a girl facing him. He jumped out of bed and never slept there again. I told him I saw the same two figures of a girl and a man and we both freaked out and had full body chills.

I thought that something was wrong in my brain and I had some sort of hallucinations until tonight. I now without a doubt believe in spirits that haven’t moved on.


TLDR: saw ghosts of a man and a girl in my freshman college room along with a lot of other weird occurrences.

So in the dream I’m in some large female clothing department store. Hundreds of nice looking outfits and accessories in many intricate rooms with displays it almost felt real in a way. I walk around until I notice a large mirror leaning on a wall. It looked out of place and I suddenly realized I was in fact dreaming. 

I approach the mirror and see a blurred reflection of myself with my eyes glowing a light blue. I admire how nice I look for a few minutes before having a dreadful feeling of being watched. A feeling I’ve experienced before in encountering any kind of entity awake or asleep. Despite the feeling there wasn’t a single person in sight during dream. When I leave the room I hear a voice in my head.

The voice was a man using a calm tone. He asked me “Why are you wanting to be different” and at the same time said “Be different, show them who you are”. The voice overwhelmed me so I panic and force my dream to end itself thinking I was unprepared for this. As i open my eyes I was on my side with my arms under my blanket but I felt hands pulling my blanket higher over my shoulder like I was being tucked in. 

I only fully realized a minute after waking up that I didn’t pull the blanket over me.

Sometimes it sounds so weird and I get concerned as to why its happening. Months ago, it didn't even sound like a meow at times. I have never heard any other cat meow the way this one does, its so offputting.

It was meowing yesterday and left after I finished reading ayatul kursi/the verse of the throne. It came again a few moments ago and stopped right when I read the first line. This is interesting because when I didn't read ayatul kursi, like the way I reacted to it months ago, the meowing would continue for long periods of time

I was walking down the block the other day around 6-7AM when I saw this alleged strange cat, it meowed very loudly at me then too, making its presence clear. I was sure to walk away from it to give it space. The fact that it did that though was odd and not very cat-like. The cat was the strangest, most intense looking cat I ever saw though, like it instantly gave me creepy vibes. I felt in my gut that it was a jinn, but even they deserve respect if they arent bothering us so I left it alone.

Anyways, I just wanted to post about our local jinn cat. Inshallah it stops bothering us and leaves us alone.

I was watching TV with my wife and heard a chime sound, looked over and a bell ornament on the Christmas tree was swinging kind of actively like it had been swatted. 
We didn't move, nothing was near it, nothing had fallen on to it, and we have no pets.
The heat had just shut off so I thought maybe it was being blown by the airflow and spun up and that it had violently untwisted, but it's been there for a month and hasn't done that before, and I payed attention to it the next time the heat turned on and it didn't budge. 
The ornament to my memory isn't particularly unique, not like handmade or anything. It's a golden bow with a small golden bell hanging from it given to us by my wife's grandmother. Her husband passed away about 13 months ago. 
Again, I'm not a believer, but this is the first thing in life I've experienced that feels slightly paranormal.

Here is the follow-up paranormal experience documented [here](https://greatspiritblog.wordpress.com/2021/12/30/the-encounter/). Copy-pasted below:

**The Encounter**

***Forward***

&gt; The following experience took place approximately two years after the events that I described in [Story](https://greatspiritblog.wordpress.com/). Please, read this in order to understand the possible context. Ever since I published it I’d been wondering how to write about the following encounter. I’m not a writer. I’ve asked several people to critique my writing since then and the most overwhelming response was just to relax and not obsess about it.

***Backstory***

&gt; I was a sophomore in college and had befriended Chris A. Actually, he may have initiated our relationship. I recall walking from the dining hall back to my dormitory when I saw Chris walking to the dining hall with his cohorts. I, distinctly, remember him pointing at me and saying: “I want to hang out with that guy”. My memory is fuzzy about the ‘why’ and I don’t think it matters too much. So, we ended up hanging out since we shared a sociology class together where we struck it off after (and during) class.

&gt; Chris was a barrel-chested tall man a little over six feet. Before enrolling at the university that we both attended, he had received one of the highest honors for graduating a lieutenant from [Valley Forge Military Academy](https://www.vfmac.edu/). If you’ve ever seen the movie entitled [TAPS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083169/) (Tom Cruise’s first role), then that would be the location it was shot.

&gt; An unusual relationship between my self (a wiry physique and averted to violence) and someone who’s been highly trained as an objective observer trained to kill. Chris had a deep love for [The Doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors) rock band. I had a general respect/appreciation for them as well. That may have been one of the things that we shared in common. I, also, was a [DJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey) with another college buddy at our university. The radio show, named The Beethoven and Socrates Hootenanny, featured anything between classical and alternative music and was extremely popular. This may have cemented our relationship further.


***Person?***

&gt; It was a private invitation-only Halloween party which featured a college band. I, personally, was acquainted with the band members that gave me and Chris the invitation. Immediately upon our arrival, Chris went inside the house. I remained outside and in front of the opened bottom floor garage where the band was ready to start. As soon as I got my first cup of beer from the party keg the band started playing. They played lots of familiar classic rock songs and I remained there until Chris showed up to let me know it was time to go. I had to get back to the university to start the aforementioned radio show.

&gt; We made our way down the winding snake-like paved driveway toward Chris’ car that was parked on the shoulder of the main road. The almost full moon, clear meteorological conditions (e.g. clear skies with no cloud cover) illuminated our way with ease.

&gt; Approximately half way down the driveway we suddenly heard three or four screaming/shouting voices, in unison and behind us, proclaim: “LOOK WHAT YOU’VE DONE TO US”!

&gt; We both turned around to see what appeared to be a person dressed up like what could, possibly,  be considered a vampire costume from our modern media. They were very pale-skinned, blonde hair slicked back, cloaked in gold-brown clothing with dark leather-like boots. This is the best physical description that Chris and I could gather from this incredibly brief encounter.

&gt; In the duration of less than one second we turned to look back at each others’ jaw-dropped faces and then back at this person. Then, right before our eyes, this person vanished or ‘winked out’. Immediately, Chris and I fanned out in opposite directions trying to locate this person. We spent, maybe, the next five minutes running around the immediate area looking for this person. Nothing.

&gt; Later, as Chris transported me back to the university, he told me that he had seen this person inside the house while I was outside listening to the band. He continued to inform me that he was standing in the kitchen, talking to a couple of girls, when this person interjected with what Chris described as “gibberish-like crazy talk”.

And if to you it's not, I respect that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, let's start this post with simply what the fuck I am, I am a death witch meaning I actively base my spirituality/witchcraft around death. For an example I talk to spirits, I try and help them if they want or just have a simple chat. The reason I became a death witch is because as ironic as it is I've always been around death, to the point it just feels like home to me, I find comfort in cemeteries and sometimes even hospitals. I didn't instantly mark myself as a death witch simply because I didn't know what it was  or that it was a thing until a few months ago.  You could also say my spiritual awakening happened because of death. 

Because my craft revolves around death and honestly so has my life, I know a thing or two about spirits from my own encounters and other people I know and trust not to lie about and I'd love to share it because I constantly see the same beliefs of mine in comments on posts but it always feels like they never get the recognition they deserve to me at least. Since probably the beginning of the 2000's it's become this like weird ass trend of becoming ""possessed"" or wanting to be haunted by a spirit who tries to kill you (if you need proof of that literally just search for it on YouTube or hell even Google - you'll get thousands possibly millions of results) and it's sometimes hilarious when you can tell how fake it is but then there's people who genuinely believe that it's all real even though in the YouTube videos it'll end in someone ""dying"" but then you never hear about it again on their channel. This is me, someone who I'll say is experienced in the paranormal, saying they are BS. One thing I hate about paranormal videos on YouTube is how much misinformation is floating around that you can blantly tell isn't real. 

An example would be that if you wear clothing that has an ouija board on it that you'll get possessed somehow, firstly ouija boards aren't as dangerous as movies and media make them out to be and I'll come to that in a moment and secondly how the actual fuck is a spirit supposed to come through some threaded pattern. 

Here's the biggest controversial thing to say on here - Ouija boards ARE NOT dangerous! I own two Ouija boards, I've been using them for years sometimes for fun sometimes because I want to see if there's any spirits about. Nothing bad has ever happened! No ones gotten possessed! It's a lot like the trendy ""omg I got possesed at 3am by the devil!"" Youtube videos. It's so easy to make up stories that you got possessed or that you know a friend of a friend who got possessed and there's also the extremely sad side of it where people use demons and possessions to try and rationalize shitty people that they know like their dad abusing them, some will say it's just him being possessed by a demon not that he's just an abusive shitty dad. I also barely ever use protection when I use an Ouija board because something I've learned is they are not portals like nearly every person will tell you online, what you talk to is already in your home or wherever you use the board unless you do a summoning or invocation spell, and you'll only ever talk to spirits unless you create the board with the intent to talk to something else like demons or angels. You might also get the odd spirit pretending to be a demon and saying you're going to die (Don't tell me you wouldn't do it if you became a spirit and was allowed to do that because I know you're lying) but it's all just jokes! You should never take what you get from an ouija board whole heartedly because some spirits lie for jokes or just because they want to keep you there talking to them (there are some though that don't lie and are really nice). 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're thinking of using an ouija board I say go for it, but don't go into it either wanting to talk to a specific person seriously, wanting to talk to a demon or just plain scared because spirits will know that and use it against you, thankfully that has never happened to me but I know someone who constantly tells me this and they are one of the few people I trust with this sort of information. You can also do it literally anywhere, if you do it in a cemetery just make sure you're not disturbing any mourners yk that kinda stuff and you're set to go, you don't need to be in darkness and with a candle to do it that's just to set the spooky mood. With the whole goodbye thing, if you talk to nothing you don't need to say goodbye but if you do you have to make sure the spirit knows you want to stop talking and that they're cool with it, if they're not try and ask them why and explain to them how you want to end the session but you could come back another time to talk (basically just treat them like an ordinary person). You can also get rid of the board however you want you don't need to burn it, just get rid of it the best way for you whether that be just throwing it in the trash or giving it away to someone. 

I've used an Ouija Board to talk to the spirits in my home before because it's an easy form of communication and I've never had a horrible experience with it and I think its a shame that media and movies have portrayed them so badly that people are deathly scared of them when in reality it's just pieces of wood, no spirits come out of it or demons. It's also really easy to fake it so don't trust any videos of it and also if you're going to play it with friends make sure they are being serious and not just in a silly goofy mood. 

&amp;#x200B;

One simple way to talk to spirits is by just talking out loud, like if you think you have a spirit in your home ask it to do something to prove it is there like a knock or a loud noise is what I go for usually and it usually happens and you don't need anything to do that that's why it's really simple. Another would be by a pendulum - you can literally just use a necklace, charger wire or earphones you don't need a fancy crystal one but you do have to be careful you're not influencing it's movements which if you're struggling with telling you can put it in a jar or get a stand for it so you know you're not moving it. You can also use tarot cards, dowsing rods there's a lot! I primarily use Ouija boards, pendulums and tarot to communicate, it depends on my mood like if I feel tired I'll use a pendulum because it's easier. 

I also do go on ghost hunts at least once a year (I didn't last year because of COVID) and I capture things a lot like I've caught photos before, on this year's ghost hunt I saw a spirit trying to hide from the group I was in because they just wanted to be left alone and I also somehow knew a door was going to open up on its own, they're really fun for me and I think if you're interested in this stuff you should definitely go on a ghost hunt if you can (and btw no they won't follow you home, if they did there would be none there to cause ghostly shenanigans that happen probably all the time at the location).  If you do I recommend taking photos every once in a while because you never know what you'll see and to take a torch with you because they will most probably turn off the lights during the investigation. 

And finally, if you think you have a spirit don't assume it's evil just because it screamed, threw something across the room etc because it probably isn't it could just be angry or scared and if it is do what you would do with a normal person - try to comfort them and figure out what you can do for them as funny as it sounds. What I always tell people when they think they have a spirit is first try and talk to them so you know for certain that you do and then try and ask if there's a certain reason they're doing what they're doing or ask them if they can stop if it's scaring you. Most nice spirits will stop it but maybe still hang about but if it doesn't then just completely ignore it, spirits feed off of your fear and emotions so if you cut that off from them they'll probably get bored and just move on to the next place they wanna go. There's a reason why blessings usually do more harm than good, to spirits it's like having a roommate tell everyone behind their back they don't want them there and then throwing their stuff out - it ain't nice.  

I've seen spirits since I was a child, I used to run away from them crying and screaming but now I just, ""Hiya, random spirit who for some reason has decided to hang out with me, wtf u want?"" And that is what I call growth, I was terrified of them as a kid because I couldn't understand why I was seeing some strange person walking around the house or why I was hearing a creepy little girls voice singing with me but I know things now, or at least I like to think so with all my experiences. I hope this post has comforted people, possibly even helped, if it has you're very welcome and you don't need to be scared of this kind of thing you just have to haves some scepticism, rational thinking and an open mind.

I was singing the lyrics to ""La vie en rose"" to myself when I was quickly startled by a loud bang that seemingly came from behind me. I thought very little of it as I'm living in Iceland and a few kilometers away from me is a erupting volcano, so I obviously just assumed it was an earthquake causing my hot tub to shake a bit.

  
I thought very little of it and after around 2 minutes or so I started singing again and I was almost instantly interrupted by the same banging except this time there were 4 thuds with about 2 seconds between each thud. The knocks were coming from what seemed to be underneath my hot tub as I had enough time to process where it was coming from this time.

At the time I didn't connect this to anything paranormal but after some thinking I've begun to consider it a possibility. I've often experienced admittedly very strange things in my home e.g my chandelier in the dining room swung to the side as my lamp started blinking rapidly before shutting off, an electrical table with buttons being pressed multiple times by themselves and objects oddly sliding off ledges.

Nothing out of the way has happened yet, but the circumstances are odd.

I first noticed a small continuous light on an IR camera that seemed to hover about 20 feet off the ground and several feet into the wood line. I looked around the area in person and couldn’t see anything. Soon after I checked the IR camera again and it was gone. Nothing reflected when I shone a flashlight around and it’s a long ways from external light sources.

The second time was in almost the exact same place. This time I saw a glinting light with the naked eye and then nothing. Nothing on IR or anything. I walked toward where I saw the light and some nearby deer took off running. It was too high to be them and or a trespasser. Plus if it was a trespasser then the deer would have ran or I would have heard/saw them. It’s really too remote for that though.

I checked this spot in the daytime on both occasions and didn’t see anything notable. It wasn’t eye shine and there are no flashing cell towers or anything in the line of sight. The angle and background wouldn’t allow for it to be a passing plane’s lights in the background of the forest.

I’ve got no idea what it could be but it’s definitely strange. I’ve been in the area for many years and never had it happen until about 2 months ago. No other strange happenings other than an odd feeling of fear one time several months ago. I chalked that up to my sixth sense letting me know a mountain lion or bear  was around.

She told me she’d been up till past 1AM, and she was awake, like full awake, and saw something crawl from the corner in her room to the ceiling.

And now here’s the part that really scares and worries me. She told me she’s been hearing whispering, seeing things out of the corner of her eye, etc. I simply told her: pray. Pray the bad spirits away and will them to go away. But that’s not enough and I don’t know what to do.

We all know they have more keen sense of smelling and hearing than us. Would that extend to a paranormal sense? 
My wife and I walk our dog once in the morning and once in the evening. 
We live in a center of a neighborhood where we have a few streets behind us and a few streets in front of us and long streets to our sides that connect the entire neighborhood out to the larger cross traffic streets. 
Often times our evening walks with her are in the late dusk to night time. Sometimes she freaks out when there is nothing there that is visible to us. 
Now she isn't the kind of dog to bark at other dogs but usually will want to play with them or just curious about them. She doesn't even bark at the neighborhood cats. Also rarely barks at people, unless they are men wearing hoodies. 

Our biggest issue is the street in front of us she absolutely refuses to go up to that street. When ever we try she will either whimper cry and pull away. So we don't force it. 
The first time we noticed this she yanked back so hard she slipped out of her collar and ran back to our street. 
A few weeks ago I was walking her in the evening and not paying attention to where we were walking as I was responding to some work emails on my phone and I went down the other side of our block and towards that street she stopped and noped it back to the other direction. 
So I know it's not something at that corner as she knows that way both sides. 

A few other times that we had gotten home late I walked her not in that direction but down another street she stopped and was staring at a brick wall like if someone was there then she cowered her head like if she was scared. I turned on my flashlight thinking maybe a small animal that I couldn't see but nothing except a brick wall.

Since my dad has passed, there have been three undeniable instances of either him connecting with me through the afterlife, or just him strongly living on through other objects and people. This first part I have posted more in depth somewhere earlier on my account: 

- Instance 1: The dream. 
It had been months since my dad passed and I wished to see him again in a dream, but had eventually given up. My dreams were just me looking for him and never finding him, and it made me too sad to keep wanting to see him so I stopped thinking about it. Weeks after leaving this wish behind, he appeared to me in a dream. He was younger, happier, and healthier. He told me not to worry, that he was happy and healthy now. That I would be okay. In this dream he appeared with a dog I have never seen before, I figured it was my mind making things up since I knew he was an avid animal lover. 

Weeks later, I found an old folder in his belongings I hadn’t gone through yet. When I opened it, a picture of a dog fell out. The exact same dog from the dream. I asked my aunt, who said that was his favorite puppy when he was younger. She didn’t know about the dream when I asked, but after I described it to her and told her where it took place, she told me he was definitely coming to me from one of his old houses where he was the most happy in his life. That was his old dog, who id never seen or heard about. It blew my mind. 

- Instance 2: The visit
It was days before thanksgiving, and I was really missing my dad. I had just celebrated my first birthday without him, followed by his first birthday without being here. It was a really tough time. I was letting my dog outside my apartment, onto my little patio in the first floor. No one ever approached this patio as it was several feet away from the passing sidewalk. 

I left her there alone and looked outside to see my dog barking at an older man, who was walking his little dog right next to my fence. I went outside to bring her in so she didn’t annoy the man, but he stopped me to talk. The way he spoke about his dog, the way he spoiled him and interacted with him was exactly like my dad did with his dog. It gave me strong nostalgic feelings but I chalked it up to him being older with a dog, the way I remember my dad. Well he began calling my dog pet names that only my dad had called her before, and it brought tears to my eyes. At the end of our simple conversation, he asked my name, and said “Happy thanksgiving OP, my name is Mike, it’s lovely to see you.”

My dads name was Mike, and it baffled me that he didn’t say it was nice to meet me, just that it was lovely to see me. 


- Instance 3: The Christmas Present
I had just got done celebrating Christmas with my family. I had secretly wished for a kitchen aid mixer, but never told anyone because I knew it was super pricey and didn’t want anyone to spend that much on a gift for me. I decided to swing by my dads old house with a plate of food, for old times sake. When I arrived, I realized someone had just moved in. It’s been almost a year so it makes sense, but I was very upset. 

I sat in my car crying for a few minutes, before deciding to pull around back and look at the house one last time before I left. He never really used the front door so I remembered the back a lot more vividly and wanted to visit it one last time. In the alley way, right outside of his house, sat a kitchen aid mixer. Someone must have gotten a new one and gotten rid of the old one, but this one was practically brand new, just sitting there to be taken or thrown away. Right outside of his house. What I now see as a last Christmas present from him. Maybe he didn’t put it there, but had I not kept him in my thoughts and went by there to see his house, I would’ve never found that. 

So yeah. That’s all of the times where I really felt my dad was still looking out for me since he has passed. I miss him everyday, and think about him everyday. I wasn’t sure of the afterlife before- and I can’t say I am sure now. But I do know that he is out there somewhere, making sure I know he’s there. I love you dad.

My memories of the events are fading and I only remember a few key details.

I was born in 1979 and shortly after my parents built a new house in the suburbs in Milwaukee for them, my older brother (by two years) and me.

One night I was in bed (about 4 or 5 years old), reading a book on the alphabet.  I was lying down with my legs bent so i could support the book and read it using my flashlight.  I was on the letter 'Q' when I felt something in the room.  I dropped my legs down and saw 'something' at the edge of my bed - it looked like a shadow.  It said 'Q' and it scared me so i dove under the covers.

A few days later I woke up and saw it again but this time it was with something else.  It looked like a small person covered in seaweed - to which I asked (assuming it was my brother for some reason) ""where did you find the seaweed, Matt?""  I think they both looked at me and i did the whole under the covers again.

The last major thing happened some other night.  I felt something grab my feet and try pulling me out of my bed.  I grabbed onto the headboard and held until it stopped.  

I never told my parents what happened.  I think I saw shadow figures around the house but I am not sure if those are real memories or not.  But I thought I saw something going in and out of my closet during this time.

On a side note, the feet being pulled on freaked me out so much that I changed my sleeping position to the fetal position until only a few years ago.  Still a little unnerved to put my feet near the edge of the bed.

One final note - at Christmas 2019, we were finished unwrapping gifts and were sitting around and talking.  Out of nowhere, my mom's music box started playing (no one has touched it in years!).  It kind of freaked all of us out - it made me think of my experiences all those years ago.

It almost looked like he was possessed by a demon at that moment. I’ll never forget it. It was very, very disturbing. I usually don’t believe in demonic possession, but the way that he suddenly transformed into an aggressive person with his eyes sinking in makes me think otherwise.

Today I got 3 sleep paralysis, around evening. Just fear and paralysis. I was mildly scared and just lying in bed. I rolled over to my side thinking if I should get up. It's evening here. Then suddenly, behind me I hear, [my name]. It was a girl's voice. She sounded enthusiastic yet calm. The voice was very soothing and cute. It was right behind me, behind my head. As if she / it was kneeling beside my bed. But the only reaction it had in me was that of pure terror. It's a voice I've never heard before. I froze up in fear and started shaking. It was loud and clear and purposeful. I don't pray to God usually but now I was praying with all my energy. And shaking.

As this was happening and I was thinking if I should get up and run and thinking I'm scared of no frigging ghost, then she called me again. Something I should mention is that, I sleep near the edge of the bed and the back of my head was close to the edge. The voice was outside my bed but right behind my head. Distance, about 8 inch. The second time knocked all the courage I had out of me. I peeked in that direction fearfully. My hand obstructing the view. I dare not move that hand. I lay praying, and shaking. Thinking about how pathetic I feel, scared of a fucking ghost. Too afraid to say, what the fuck do you want.

I hear again, *heyy*. I'm beyond scared now. Trying to rationalize it with whatever is left of my sanity. Hypnogogic hallucination, hypnopompic hallucination... but I'm awake and I heard her. It's a cute enthusiastic hey. But it doesn't do me any good when there was no cute girl in my room to begin with. It's a voice I ve not heard before.

Again, *hey.* This time it sounded like 3 people spoke at the same time. Synced. If she's gonna say it again I might piss my pants. I mustered up courage and looked. Then I got the fuck out of there.

Happened about 30 mins back. I'm scared now. I don't need any cute voices in my room I just wanna sleep. I'll go in my bed with an extra set of pjs next time, because if I hear these again, I'll need them.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,939222,public,new,self,Something weird happened and I'm scared,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rreesy/something_weird_happened_and_im_scared/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it might not have anything too impacting , I think this story is one of many where pets see dead people. 

In march of 2021, my grandpa died of liver complications. He was found dead 2 days later as he lived alone. Later that same night , I placed a candle and picture of him in my room. At around I’d say 9-10 PM, my little husky starts aggressively barking into my room. Huskies don’t really bark unless they are bothered or concerned , most of the times they yap, do quick sounds, howl or just let a small bark. But this time, it sounded like she was ready to gut alive whoever she was barking at. 

I stepped closer and felt a feeling of being watched, and as I could see better I saw her barking at the picture of my grandfather. She kept getting in a pouncing position, and kept looking back at me almost saying “are you seeing this ??!”. I was a little freaked out, but I just choose to ignore it and I told my grandpa “just make sure you close your eyes when I beat my meat if you’ll be in here “. And laughed it off. That same night at around 12, she begins barking in the living room. Outside as well, we placed a large picture of him with roses and candles . This time I didn’t check, just let my grandpa be here for a little bit. Eventually , the barking stopped. Ever since this , my dog has only barked once, and that was in the corner of my sisters room. 

I like to believe my grandpa was there, and in life he was a very youthful and happy person, so he was probably playing around with my dog, only my dog probably was spooked and got defensive. As of for us, we were his first and favorite grandchildren, so I think he choose to visit us first. I also didn’t get to see his body as I was at work, but the rest of my entire family did and he probably wanted to say his goodbyes to me, as I was his oldest grandson .

My friend showed up to work the other day and he was the first one there. He was sitting there looking at his phone and saw something moving out of the corner of his eye. Almost immediately after the motion sensor lights came, but nothing was over there.

Then a couple minutes later the light and fam came on inside the locked bathroom, Also motion sensors. Once that happened he left the building and waited in his car for more people to arrive.

He also said the motion sensors have gone off on a room once before.

When I was about 5, I can recall a time that I was in the restroom at my house, (and this is going to sound ridiculous,) but while I was sitting down, I looked up and I could see a ram’s face behind the ceiling vent looking down at me. The ram has glowing red eyes and appeared to be grinning at me, locking its stare until I left. I never encountered this again however it’s stayed with me forever.

The second incident occurred a couple years later when I was laying down on my family room floor. I had just woken up early that morning, and as I was still laying down I noticed a ghostly transparent white figure wearing a dress, floating past me as it entered another room. The figure did not say anything, however it also has red glowing eyes similar to the ram. I also never seen the figure again.

The third incident was the last one I’ve experienced. When I was about ten, I can recall laying on my couch in the family room, watching a popular Nickelodeon show called Legends of the Hidden Temple. In the television show there is a enormous talking tiki man that is basically the mascot. My asthma was acting up that day, and while watching the show I had to take a few puffs of my medication. As I was watching the show, I felt my body freeze, and the tiki man on the screen turned his attention to me and said something which I cannot remember. All I can recall, is that the screen also had a red snowy tint as this was happening. I felt as if I was in a trance and could not move or clear my mind from what I was watching.

There are more things that happened but this gives you the idea.

I have acknowledged the entity and I am respectful, I never taunt it. Once when the keys were taken, I just told it that it wasn't funny, please return my keys. I left the room for a few minutes and when I came back, they were on my bed. It loved taking keys, as it happened 3 other times.

Yesterday, I was cleaning my room and decided to take a break. I sat on my bed, reading. I was accompanied by my cat, Tiffy at the foot of my bed. All of a sudden, we heard the garbage bag moving. She quickly turned toward the sound. I got up and saw that the bag was on it's side as I look around, I look at some laundry that was on the foot of the bed and I see a sleeve being moved. 

It was something that I never expected. We usually see things after they've been moved or broken. There was one other time when it threw a tray of cosmetics off of my makeup table. My daughter was with me and saw it happen.

I feel that it's gotten bolder. I immediately had my daughter come in to my room. She brought her dousing rods, hoping for answers. She asked it if it wanted to hurt me and it answered yes. She asked it if I had a bad heart and again it answered yes. My friend says that my daughter influenced it, but I'm not sure about that.

I’d never heard that before, and it sent chills down my spine. I always knew my old house was haunted, but the story got much creeper after reading that. So here we go.

My wife and I were living in an apartment, and my great aunt was looking to sell her home. The house was built in the 50’s and needed some work, and my Aunt didn’t feel like taking care of it, so she suggested she take the apartment and we buy the house. It was 2005, and the market was going NUTS, so it worked out for everyone: we got a fixer-upper for a fair price and she got an apartment without the hassle.

The house was always full of people. We had friends live with us for a while, then my brother, then we had kids. And when we first moved, we had two cats. Not long after the move, our younger cat got very, VERY ornery. He was constantly hissing, refused to use the litter box, scratching at everyone. That was NOT him, though. In the apartment, he would cuddle on the back of my neck while I watched TV and purred constantly. I didn’t even know he COULD hiss until we moved. So after ruining our second load of laundry by urinating in it, we decided maybe he just needed to stretch his legs and explore outside. The very first night we let him out, he failed to come back in. We shook treats, put out food, nothing. By 10pm I went out to look for him. My heart broke when I found him just outside the window of a spare room, no signs of trauma. Just…dead. I sadly buried the cat by an old tree, feeling totally guilty that I didn’t do more for him. I feel even worse now after reading the aforementioned Paranormal post.

After the cat passed I started sleep-walking, actually opened up the basement door and fell down a flight of stairs. That sucked. Tried walking out of the house in the middle of a New England winter (and was luckily stopped by my wife).  Every once in a while I’d get creeped, or hear a strange sound, but it was nothing really noteworthy and could be explained as someone else making noise.

My wife would hear voices. My son, who was 2 or 3 at the time and has 2 older siblings, started waking up at 2 or 3 in the morning crying. It should be noted that his bedroom was the old spare - the one with the window I found my cat under. Our other cat would go into his room and stare at the top corner of his wall. The dogs would growl outside the door, but not enter. All pretty explainable. My wife was getting nervous, but I just laughed it off. We live close to the neighbors. My sons hitting a developmental milestone. Maybe squirrels are getting into the attic. 

My great aunt passed away a few years after our owning the house, and shortly after, our first cat got very ill. He started peeing everywhere - just like our second - and later died of CHF. That’s when things went from weird to scary. 

We were watching my brothers son one day. I hear giggling in my sons room, it’s my nephew. I walk in and he is pointing at the corner the cat used to stare. Just creepy giggling. My son started saying things like “ I don’t want to go to bed. He gets mad” or “the shadow went over there”. I still laughed it off out loud, but was getting creeped out. That uneasy “someone’s here” feeling kept hitting, harder and harder.

Then the 3AM stuff. Super cliche, but hand to god I had never heard of “the witching hour” until I started talking to guys at work (that’s how creeped I was getting, I told people about this craziness). I’d wake up in a cold sweat. No big deal, though falling back to sleep was tough because I felt like someone was watching. Then, for absolutely no reason, at 3:01 my smoke detector starts going off. “FIRE. FIRE. FIRE.” Goes off three times, then stops. Check the house - nothing. Change the batteries and go back to bed. The next morning, 3:01 “FIRE. FIRE. FIRE.” Goes off three times, then stops. I get up again, nothing. After the 4th night, I am totally spooked. Then, inexplicably, it stops.

We ended up moving shortly after. It was our dream to move North, and plans were in motion before things got too wild, but the timing really worked for us. We moved into an 1850’s farmhouse. I have never felt safer. No creepy feelings, the kids are sleeping better, I’ve even stopped sleep walking. As a side note, the people that bought our house never even moved in. They put the house back on the market, where it’s sat for almost a year.

I drove to an empty parking lot which has a beach, in the woods, and it's winter (snow and -9 C).

While i was there i put the car in park and put the daylight LED's on, they dim once the car is in park. There was a building which hosts the beach activities i guess, i would look there and see movement from the corners of my eyes. I looked into one of the windows real good and thought what i saw to believe was an old man standing and moving slightly. but i doubted this.

I got real scared in my car, i felt something was staring at me. I put up my windows and put on some light techno music. I could hear noise from outside my car. Footsteps walking around. It would stop then my whole car would shake. The footsteps lasted all night.

I could see shafows in my peripheral all night. At one point it sounded like they were trying to communicate but it was only coming in as like a howl.

At one point I looked out my passenger window and saw a 6' approx. skinny white transparent figure (ghost) flying upward diagonally at a relatively quick velocity.

I saw shadows all night, heard noises around my car, the odd thump on it too. I even saw a very disting dog like animal but only its skeletal outline was semi visible (transparent) moving around outside biriefly.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rmpw00/new\_entity\_visited\_me\_today\_trying\_to\_understand/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rmpw00/new_entity_visited_me_today_trying_to_understand/)

I am absolutely *terrified*. I don't know what to do. The smell of rotting/decaying flesh comes and goes but is increasingly worse and harder to handle. I didn't know this could be a sign of demonic activity until tonight. I literally thought something crawled in and died (I live in an RV), but trust me when I say I have searched high and low for a carcass, that there is zero evidence of rodent activity in/around my trailer, etc... 

This is really personal but I think it's important to say, in case this is really a demonic presence. I tried to take my own life here at home about a month ago. I was committed to the psych ward for awhile. When I got home, that's when the smell, disturbances, encounters etc all started. Could it have ""discovered"" me in my vulnerability, and is now harassing me??

I thought I had a gas leak. To the point where I called 911. No gas leak of any kind, and I got a brand new carbon monoxide detector (alongside the other gas detectors in my trailer). No gas leaks. 

The smell does not exist outside. Only inside. Sometimes it's worse than other times. It's worse in one area of the trailer than the other. Etc. 

The entity who overtly visited me seemed harmless and friendly at first, but she turned really scary. I used videos of a Hindu chanting (I am not religious, and I'm a white-ethnicity USA citizen, but it felt appropriate) and at first everything got SO MUCH SCARIER but then the entity left... I am scared to put the chanting back on because of how much more terrifying everything initially got. On Christmas I for WHATEVER REASON set out a little milk offering to the entity (overnight, tossed it the next day). Had another brief encounter with her a couple days later (maybe next day). Not since then, at least nothing overt. Now it's more sensing a presence and being absolutely scared shitless.

I am sitting here, terrified. It's almost 5am, I cannot sleep. I feel a presence in here. It's terrifying me just to type. I am 100% avoiding looking down the length of the trailer because I'm certain I will see something, I am so sure. I have the lights on. I have my favorite comedy TV show on full-volume. But I feel like I am losing my fucking MIND. I don't know what to do. I don't have anybody who believes me about this stuff, they just think I'm losing it and need meds. I need help. I'm too scared to get out of bed. I can't wait for the sun to come up.

Please, anything to help me get through tonight, and any advice for what I can do tomorrow to try to get this fucker out of my life. I usually am very welcoming of paranormal encounters. I have had many. I remain calm and collected, even when they are kinda scary. But this is something else. God I'm getting chills writing that.

This is just a sweet story that happened earlier this evening with a bit of backstory.

My grandfather passed away in October. It was rather sudden (Covid) and I took it especially hard as I was very close to my Grandparents on that side of the family. 

My grandmother passed in April 2017, but suffered from dementia the 10 years prior. I guess because her mind was so gone she was hard to mourn, but to me it felt she was survived by my grandfather- like as long as he was around it still felt like she was too. 

The Cemetery they're now both buried in is only a mile from my house,  so I frequently drive past it. Whenever I'm alone in the car I say outloud, ""I love you guys,"" and blow a kiss in their direction, but if my son is in the car with me I just say it in my head and keep going. 

Today my son is with me and I'm sitting at the stoplight staring towards the Cemetery and say in my head,  ""I love you guys"" like always, then my son says out of nowhere... 

""Hey Mom.  I want to listen to that song that says... 'we love you... we love you..."" 

See, we haven't listened to the song he brought up in months,  but it was the perfect moment- I felt like my grandparents were reminding me they are still here with me and they love me and they hear me. It brought tears to my eyes.

I was house sitting for a coworker, he just moved into a new big house. Man got lucky since he banked off that GameStop shit. I was excited to do this, big house all to my self. 
The first couple nights I was there were normal. Nothing weird happened. Take care of the pets, go to sleep and so on. The unexplainable things happened about the third night. I was in a bed at about 11:30 pm, gotten all ready for bed. Then I started hearing things getting pushed around upstairs which was weird cause the pets were in the basement the entire time I was there. Cat would be on the bed with me and the dog had a bed right next to the one I was in. I didn’t think too much about things being pushed around. Next time came around, about the same time as before but instead of hearing things being pushed around, I heard kids laughing for about ten minutes straight. I could not sleep that night cause I felt like I was being watched. didn’t have to work the next day so I begged a few friends to come over and stay the night, thankfully they did and not a single event happened when we all slept. Sadly, they couldn’t stay for the rest of the time I was there. The next night was somewhat the same as the first. Still happened around the same time and heard things being moved around. But the next night was something I couldn’t believe. Again, around 11:30 pm, but I didn’t hear anything, I just saw something. It’s a weird thing to describe but I’ll try my best. When I looked up I felt nothing but stares, there was this beam that looked like a steel rod when it gets heated. It let out a glowing aura but had no light. It was sticking through the door but not on the sides. It was coming through the wood of the door. I looked at this for a few minutes and just tried falling back asleep. The night after was nothing new, same time as usual, a few giggles and things moving.

Now this Is gonna be a scuffed and terrible writing.. I'm bad at writing i do apologize but do enjoy.

I'll talk about my room first as it's the most interesting, so my room is abit of a creepy place, now the spirit that seems to be attached to me I call Bill. Now Bill is a uhhh how do I put it, nice but strange spirit. I always feel constantly watched by them the only free time I get from them is during the dirty (atleast they give me personal space) or out in Public but If I dare talk about Bill they'll make themselves known even right now as writing this I can feel bill near me, now up to encounters ive had quite a few encounters, orbs, figures, whispers, breathing but never objects moving or anything physical. Now I have proof of orbs through sending random stuff to my girlfriend, but I gotta figure out how to send or attach them anyways  orbs as I said I've captured quite a few videos but I've only been able to recover 1 video the rest have seemed to kinda vanish from exsistece, figures. On many accounts I have seen figures jolt past me or stand in the corner of my eye, they seem to shadowy and dark with no details through just that alone, possibly a shadow person, whispers and breathing. These are rare but when they happen it's very clear. I've heard my name be called next to me, my girlfriends name are the only 2 things I've heard it say. Breathing, similar situation, I've only heard it breath in my ear or by my computer desk which I'll now explain a theory, now none of this ever started to happen until I got this computer desk for 10 dollars off one of my mums Co workers, it's very nice desk btw, I believe it's possibly attached to the desk for some reason I'm not. But I dont wanna get rid of it as the spirit has done nothing to harm me and I'm too afraid to tell it to leave. Something that just came to me a few nights ago I was laying in bed watching yt, and I saw something on corner of my eye and I thought ""oh here we go again"" when I look to see what it was, it was a glowing white head just peeping out looking at me, and I started at this thing for a good 3 seconds but felt like 3 years, before it slowly decended down under what I believe to be my bed and from that night I've been terrified to look under my bed at night unless I got lights on and I got a protection stone on me. I've also seen dark hands come on from up under the bed, so frankly idk what to do man. Anyways this is getting real long.

Next part, the hallway, now the hallway is a part that scares the living fucking shit outta me. There is a old dude who chills in that hallway but dont be fooled, he puts an extreme pressure on your entire body even my girlfriend who's dealt with her own demon for many years is terrified of him, my mum was attacked by him when we first got to the house, my dad who denies the existence of them has felt the pressure. on top of that a very dark shadow figure peeking from the hallway has been seen a few times by me. It's just abit of a scary situation. I do have a sister but i've never asked her about the hallway as she's still abit young.

My sister's room, this one will be short as I dont have much to say. This room is basically anti male, ive walked in that room many times and the only thing I've felt in that room was a pure distaste towards me, not even my dad will walk in there, only my mum or sister can go in there.

Finally, the hider, the hider is a nickname for a certain ghost who hides constantly, their presence is barely feel able but if I focus enough I can feel them and know they fear something in that house I think it's the hallway ghost. Other than that, not much else is known really.

about 6'0) I lived in a gated community at the time so it was nearly impossible for someone to even jump the fence without hurting themselves intensely let alone get past security, I went inside
to my aunt and grandma to explain what happened as I'm screaming and crying from fear they didn't believe me or tell my mom so I brushed it off and never told my mom fast forward
a month I was sleeping in the living room because I was always too scared to sleep alone and my mom was sleeping next to me because her and
my step dad were going through a bad divorce, anyways I lay down and I look to my left and I see a man who was dark and around the same height as the guy I saw previously; my mom heard me scream and see saw him too but this time he was inside not on the outside she went to grab a weapon but he disappeared without a single trace, she saw all windows and doors were locked so it's impossible for someone to had broken in, it wasn't the first time she experienced this either but she was shocked because she never thought it would affect me in anyway due to the fact that it stopped around the time she got pregnant with me but got intensely worse when I was around a year old she refuses to this day to tell me any details but every single month or so l would see this 'shadow man'. I think it’s very valuable for me to mention that this figure followed me around, not just on daily things but where ever I moved, I had left my original apartment that me and my family lived in from 2005 to 2011 , my mom and I moved to Florida for 2 years then back to my home state and are staying in a place that is 45 minutes way from the first place where I saw the ‘shadow man’ it follows me everywhere from different states even to friends houses or when I go sleep at a family members house but anyways now I'm 17, but around when I turned 16 things got bad I had learned to live with this spirit but when I turned 16 things took a turn for the worst I'd wake up with scratch marks, the constant feeling of being watched, etc it was bad but about 3-4 months ago it started affecting my school and everyday life, I got into an accident due to my brakes being cut bad luck seemed to be following me everywhere every time some type of bad thing were to happen I’d see a dark figure around me (most the time the things that were to happen that were bad were around the night time) around that time I started sleeping with my lights on (not to sound like a little kid) but a fear of the dark started to emerge after I found myself waking up around 3 AM for no reason at all and hearing very dark things such as ""help me he's hurting me"" or growls, the list goes on nightmares are nearly daily now, it's really bad things too, such as someone doing black magic on me or someone reading the Quran backwards , snakes with red eyes, the list goes really long...I don't know how much more I can take of this, I need help but every Islamic person tells me it's black magic that's been done for generations on my family basically meaning something dark giving misfortune will be following the future generations of my family.. it is really starting to show badly but we've all lost kids at a young age, my brother was the most recent he died in 2019 at 17...

Forgive me if my grammar isn’t up to par, I’m a tad bit dyslexic. 

I had a truly mind blowing situation happen to me about 3 years ago. 
I would say this was March 2018.

I was on my way to pickup my former girlfriend from work. There’s usually a long stretch of road that spans about a mile or so with no stop lights or signs. On both sides of the road there is a massive collection of bushes and overgrown weeds. Unfortunately, the homeless tend to set up camp within such shrubbery.

I was going down this road, and a transient darted across the road and tripped! I had to slam on the breaks to keep myself from hitting them. I remember being frustrated and vocal about the entire situation. Out of no where I was reminded by something my mother used to tell me as a child. “Never mistreat someone, because you’ll never know if it’s Jesus in disguise”. I felt disgusted with the way I reacted and I immediately regretted my actions and wished that person well.

  Well, a second later as I’m driving away from the scene, a sudden thought crossed my mind. “I gotta be thankful nothing happened, like it could have been worse. What if a car darted out of the opposite side of traffic and hit me head on?”  Here I was trying to be mindful, but I was perplexed as to why I thought about that specific scenario.

Well, at the end of said road is a small little Catholic Church. -

As I’m nearing this church, a red sports car just suddenly darts out of their lane (oncoming traffic) and is literally coming towards my truck head on. I reacted in such a calm and calculated manner, almost as if I predicted or knew it was going to happen and swerved my truck out of the way and remained in control and continued on.


I was in disbelief after it had happened, but also a lot more collected than I ever expected myself to be in a life or death situation.

I have no idea how to grasp said scenario.

I just wanna throw this in, recently I was told by a medium that I have a very strong sixth sense/ intuition. Not sure how much it adds to it.

But what are your thoughts on this?

I came back to my hometown for the holidays. It's a fairly rural area with woods and everything is peaceful. I love going to pick wild berries and I was doing just that when I encountered the first paranormal experience of my life. It happened in the backyard of my neighbour (There are wild berry shrubs there)

Here are a few details so that the story makes sense. I used to have an old man, who lived alone as my neighbour and he was a very kind person. He used to give us those berries as candied sweets. He passed away due to cardiac failure when I was in high school and his house is empty ever since. I wanted to make those sweets for my family as a holiday comfort food and thus, went to his place. Now as he passed a few years ago, there was a lot of undergrowth and wild grass in his yard and everything was messy. 

I cleared some of the growth and made way to the shrubs, cleaning the place as much as I could, thinking about how clean he used to keep everything. All this time I had a feeling that something was off, and that I was being watched but I brushed it off. I was 2 minutes into picking when I heard my neighbours voice, I'm sure it was him, saying I should be more careful and to pick up the rake immediately. It was as if I was fainting, everything was fast or slow I can't really explain that. But as soon as I picked the rake, some homeless man tried to stab me with a knife. I used the sharp end of the rake to scare him off and kept shouting loudly. He ran off.

Now onto the dream, I normally have pretty vivid dreams and for the most no nightmares, The dream starts off in my room and Im laying in my bed and slightly wake up in the dream when I feel something touch my leg, it was a shrivled black hand and when I knocked It off of me at least I think i did, It started coming from under my bed and when I saw its face it scared me awake, its face reminded me of the jabberwokiee dance team the mask at least.

Finally I took a step, then another on to them and within about three feet I completely lost my balance because I had to use both hands to hold the crab container. I dropped my crabs as soon as I lost my balance. But before I was able to lose my footing I felt a hand grab the collar of my shirt and pull me back. I turned around and saw a woman I’m a vest  holding onto me and asked “are you okay” I don’t remember what I said because I was more concerned about the fact that I just dropped all ten of my crabs on to 2 stories of escalator. when I got to the bottom I was able to collect all of them unharmed. However, I never noticed the lady in the vest getting off because me and my dad were at the base of the escalators.

Many years back, when I was a teen, I was visiting this friend, he lived in a very old (probably over 100 years old) very big house (two stories, rooms about 4 meters tall) in a very marginal part of the city, a few streets from a church. I was always creeped out by the house because of how poorly illuminated it was and because I didn't know it fully. Since the rooms were so tall they illuminated the house with lamps that were on top of the furniture and such, because of that the roofs were completely pitch black.

Well, when I was visiting him this time his parents weren't around and we decided to play videogames, during our game he had to go to the bathroom so I was left alone, now, his room connected with a passage way that went left or right, to the left were his parents' room and to the right the bathroom and then the entrance and other rooms of the house.

I noticed he was taking a long time, so I started peeking at the passage way to see if I could see him, since it was still taking a long time I kind of got a little anxious and I went to the passage way to wait for him there, to my surprise, he was there, I see him, my friend was walking by, stood there when he saw me, I started talking to him but he started going to his parents' room, like just casually going without minding me. I continued talking and following him through the long passage way (I'll say about 5 meters) thinking nothing of it, then when I entered the bedroom, nothing... There was no one in the bedroom except myself, I see my reflection in a mirror that was pointing right at the entrance and immediately got creeped out, I start looking for my friend in the bedroom and screaming his name, thinking he hid to prank me or something, then I heard him, ""almost done!"", that voice didn't come from inside his parents room, I followed it and the voice came from the bathroom, my friend was still at the bathroom, he hasn't left it yet...
I got really spooked, waited next to the bathroom door for him to come out and told him about it when he did. He told me that he experienced some weird stuff there like orbs, but nothing like it at all.

I believe this is the only paranormal event I ever experienced in my whole life, I remember it so vividly even after over a decade. Even when questioning what happened myself, I'm a very shy and polite guy, I would have never gone to the bedroom of the parents of my friends on my own, I would have only gone if my friend guided me there. I don't remember if the apparition ever said a word, or if it even looked like my friend because of how dark the house was but I remember clearly that there was a shadowy person, and the mirror, a very old very big mirror that paralyzed me when I saw it.

The TLDR of it is that the house loved my family and loved having a bunch of rambunctious kids, so it protected us and kept us safe from harm. We had trouble selling it because the house didn't want to let us go, but we were finally able to sell it after we said a formal goodbye and cleansed it. 

We sold it to a family with young children a few years ago, and I thought that was the end of it.

Last week, my mom and I were driving through our old town to visit a school when we thought it would be nice to visit our old neighbors, who my parents are still very close with. We passed our old house and just...our mouths dropped open with horror. The paint was peeling, the yard was patchy and dead, and the windows were broken. We drove around the block and the beautiful wooden fence was half torn down, and the backyard was covered in sawdust and litter.

We pulled up to our neighbors house, and she told us that the family had moved out, and some influencer couple was trying to ""remodel"" it, but gave up because it was ""too hard"".

Without giving away my location, I want to say that that house was the most gorgeous piece of art I have ever seen. It was 3 stories, with deep white paint, an ornate fence, a purple door, a small wood in the back, and a garden that looked straight out of a storybook. Or at least it did when my family lived there.

My dad and mom kept that house as sharp as possible in the decade we lived there. My dad taught me the importance of keeping the fence, which bordered an intersection, clean and neat, and how to safely pick up the empty bottles and cigarette butts. My mom grew gorgeous flowers and rinsed out the birdbath every Saturday. My brothers would mow the lawn every weekend, and my dad always had something to fix or paint to keep everything looking great. Thanks to my parents teaching me and my brothers the importance of having a clean, tidy yard and house, I grew up in a place that looked like a fairytale.

Now the house is unfuckingrecognizable. The yard is COVERED in bottles and butts, the fence is half torn down, what paint is left is chipping and peeled, and the lawn looked like it was completely overgrown before it died. My mother's flowers that bordered the front walk are dead. The wood, which offered a much needed area to get away and was the setting of many areas of playing pretend, is all gone. The sundial, which is extremely important in my mother's culture, the one we left for the new family, was broken. What's ironic is that the sundial had an inscription that asked, ""My face marks the sunny hours, what can you say of yours?"". Not much, apparently.

I'm just so heartbroken and upset.

I currently live in a split level house with my girlfriend, my grandma, my mom, and my brother. My gf and I have the downstairs area to ourselves while they have the upper floor. When we first moved here we didn't pay much attention to the weird stuff that happened but over time, things became more noticeable.

 We have this back room that used to be the reptile room and office. When that was still the case, we would hear banging in the room like one of the tank lids were being pushed on and then snapping back down. I assumed this was one of the the snakes attempting an escape. However, I soon realized this was not the case as I started going to check as soon as I heard the noise. All the snakes would be in their hide boxes. They are all too big to get back into their hide boxes this fast so there is no way it was one of them. During this time, we would also hear stuff being dropped or knocked over but when we would check, nothing had been moved. 

There was an incident where I had gone to the kitchen upstairs while my gf was taking a shower. She didn't know I was up there at that time. She had gotten out and while she was drying off she heard my voice calling her into that back room, and the sound came from that room. When I came down the stairs as she walked out of the bathroom, she was visibly startled and confused.

A few months ago I converted that room into a kitchen and moved the animals to a different room. We still hear noises but things started happening in other rooms. We have a sliding glass door to the back yard in our living area. The lock is busted so we keep a pvc pipe in the track so it can't be opened from the outside. We very rarely use this door for anything and put the pipe back every time since someone had tried to break in once. I have come to notice that sometimes the pipe is just not in the track. I've asked everyone in the house if they have used this door for any reason and no one has touched it. We started putting a brick on top of the pipe and it doesn't seem to move anymore. Since that stopped, if I'm awake in the middle of the night, and it's quiet, the dead bolt on the front door will loudly unlock itself with no sound of a key. Sound is oddly amplified where the front door is so anything touching that door is very audible from our living area, including when someone puts a key in the lock to unlock the door. I had heard it once when I was at the bottom of the stairs. I went to check and it was definitely unlocked. My mom and grandma never leave this door unlocked. Doesn't matter who is home, they lock the door when they close it, every single time.

Something I've also noticed is that my things tend to go missing and reappear in odd places. Usually it's things I use often like my ceramic travel mug, but sometimes it'salso things I rarely touch. I hadn't had a problem with this until we had moved in here.

Something I didn't know until recently is that my gf had been experiencing things touching her. Our computer desks used to be in our bedroom. When she would sit at her desk, sometimes she would feel something touch her leg. She said it felt like someone put their hand on her thigh and squeezed for a moment. Then let go. It usually happened when I was asleep and she was worried about freaking me out by telling me but I had a similar experience when she was at work. I wasn't feeling well and ended up crashing for a bit. I woke up to what felt like someone grabbing my ankle, but when I looked, no one was there. Once we moved the desks, the touching stopped. I'm assuming because we're not in the bedroom much anymore.

With all this, I wanted to do a cleansing in the house with some sage but I have a bit of a problem. My grandma has COPD. Burning stuff like that can cause her serious problems since she doesn't use breathing treatments. She only has an emergency inhaler. I don't think anything bad will come of all this but it's still concerning.

My sister and I used to share a small room in the old side of the house, while my parents stayed in their room in the new portion on the opposite side. Our room had a big wooden sliding pocket door that we would leave open at night, which means the sight line from my bed went right into the old living room, which became our play room. 

In the middle of the night toys would make noises and rattle around in the playroom. In the early 2000s there was this thing called a password journal. It was supposed to be able to recognize your voice only when you said your password and it would open. As 90s-00s technology worked… it didn’t, and after the first time I opened it with my voice I was never able to again. However, in the middle of the night I would hear the password say “what’s you password?” and then silence followed by it saying “correct!” and opening, all from the pitch black playroom. Maybe it was a coincidence, but it always spooked me. 

In another instance my parents bought my sister and I these little mini piano things from an estate sale where the man had died. Eventually, they ended up in the extra bedroom above our room because they weren’t used as much, that room was like our attic. But every night, the piano would play one key over and over from upstairs. We made our parents make sure nothing was pushing the keys down, etc. But nothing was .

There are many other instances of toys being played with, among other things, but these are the most notable. I never saw a full apparition or anything. Except once, kind of. In the middle of the night I woke up, looked into the playroom where I could clearly see the whole couch, and saw a long black figure laying there. I knew it wasn’t either of my parents, they never slept on the couch and if they were to it would be on one of the nicer couches in the new living room, not this ratty old one. I never told anyone as no one believed in these sorts of things.

I became so terrified of that room that no matter how bad I had to pee or how sick I felt during the night, I would not go out there to get to the rest of the house. Neither would my sister.

Years later, I heard my mom telling her cousin about the previous owner, an older woman, who had died on a couch in my sister and I’s bedroom right under the window that my bed was under. Immediately it clicked for me and I told her about what I saw.

Today, my sister and I have our own rooms in the new part of the house, and virtually no one goes into the old part of the house. Even when I do, I still turn the lights off and run. It has such an eerie and uncomfortable feeling. I always feel watched. Strangely, I have never had more than once experience on the new side of the house.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,938815,public,new,self,Ghost Playing with My Toys,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rqnuj5/ghost_playing_with_my_toys/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time, however, was the first time I did not feel as though I was in danger, which makes me more curious than other direct encounters I have had with what I believe to be a separate spirit. I have had several encounters with the spirit of a woman who I believe killed her child, and another singular encounter with some entity who I believe was benevolent and had a “conversation” of sorts with me. If anyone would like to know more about either of these entities/occurrences or thinks the occurrences may be related in some way, I’d be glad to share them here via a new post, or in the comments.

To begin, I work swing shift  after classes and often get home around 3am, by the time I was showered and ready for sleep it was exactly 4, I wasn’t quite ready for sleep yet though so as I often do I had one earbud in and listened to a podcast as I fell asleep. 2 hours later I woke up, which was super strange as I am a heavy sleeper that sets multiple alarms to be able to get up in the morning. Sleeping on my side with my back to the door, I could see a soft blue light shining across my ceiling through my open bedroom door, then I heard my name called. My name is not typical, and is distinctly non podcast so I know it was not that. As the podcast was still playing when I was awoken I replied “what?” Twice loudly in my morning grogginess thinking it was just my mom getting me because she needed help with something. However, after the second “what” the door quickly closed and I figured she had become annoyed and left, so I quickly grabbed a hoodie and left my room after her, but when I got the living room no one was there, and when I checked outside her car was already gone. 

After checking for her car and seeing it gone I gave her a call and she told me she had not come into my room, and after having relayed my story to her I also realized that our hallway lights are yellow as well, not blue which is what woke me up.

- when you walked into my bedroom, it would feel as if your energy was being drain. super heavy air and it was hard to be comfortable 
- i’d see shadows in the bathroom constantly
- i was honestly just terrified of that house, i slept completely covered by my blankets since day 1 of moving there. i was terrified of waking up, opening my eyes, and seeing something, so i just covered my eyes with my sheets like a tent

now one day, it all kinda came to an end. but it was an awful end for me. that house had a sort of playroom, it was attached to the living room and it’s where i had all of my toys and games. i was playing there when i suddenly felt myself get goosebumps all over my body and felt as if someone was breathing right over my shoulder next to my ear. i heard an almost inaudible word be whispered into my ear and i immediately erupted into tears, running out to my mom who was in the backyard.

 i didn’t tell her what happened for like thirty minutes because i was so in shock but once i did, she just stayed out in the backyard with me and asked my dad (who was out with friends) to come pick us up. after that day, nothing ever really happened again. we were in the process of moving (unrelated to my experiences) and moved out about a month later. my mom always said it might’ve been a spirit upset over us/me leaving?? she also didn’t tell me this at the time, but a one of the previous owners parents had died in my bedroom probably about 30-40 years ago. 

so i guess with this i ask, that had to have been something right? not just me being a scared little kid? i know my mom has always been a lot more susceptible to energies and strange happenings so she’s always been a big believer in the paranormal so she does agree with me on this. 

but also, is there any way that the spirit might have latched on to me? i haven’t had too many weird experiences since moving out of that house, but i still do have them at times. in new houses where no one has died, no relatives that i was close to having passed away, nothing that would seem to be a marker for stuff to happen. 

but i do almost always get the feeling that i’m not really alone. and that combined with my moms theory that it might’ve been a spirit upset over us leaving it just always leaves me wondering. 

or maybe it’s anxiety now haha. anyways yeah, that’s my story and i hope someone maybe can make some sense of it or has a similar experience. i just wish i knew how to tell good and bad energies apart.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,938706,public,new,self,experience i had as a child,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rqgobt/experience_i_had_as_a_child/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not sure, but I think I had an out of body experience. I know that sounds fucking insane, but let me try to explain. I was above myself and I saw everything perfectly, then I fell back into myself, and I woke up. I was in exactly the awkward position I'd dreamed about, I had a ""unique"" pillow mark on my right eye that I also saw in my dream, and I'm not going into much detail here, but there was A LOT of things going on. This happened at the end of October and ive tried to explain it to myself, but I can't.

Yesterday, I was sat in the bath, at about 2pm / 3pm and i hadn't scratched myself or knocked myself or anything like that, but i felt this burning on my arm and literally, a scratch appeared down my left forearm right in front of my eyes. Even if I had scratched myself, it wouldn't have still been there are 2:30am, which is when I took the picture I will link to. It's still there now, nearly 24 hours later. I also watched a bruise appear on my wrist right before my eyes too.

If this was just stuff involving me, I would try to ignore it, but it also seems to relate to someone I know. I have zero reason to believe this is true, but I have such an incredibly strong feeling that they are struggling. I dreamed something was going to happen the night before I last saw them, and it happened when we were together, and it played out exactly as I dreamed it would.

We were together, as a couple, for fifteen years, and I dunno, but it's like there is some kind of telepathy thing going on with her. I started having serious trouble sleeping and ""sensing"" something was wrong with her in mid December, I dont know what triggered it, but it's getting stronger.

She was also in my dream that I mentioned earlier, the ""out of body experience"" one, and even though I have never been there, I could see her in the bedroom, and I'm convinced in what I saw.

I'm not her favourite person at the moment, she's filed for a divorce of our 5 year marriage after all, so I'm wary to reach out and ask if she's ok, but I'm not an ogre, and if I ""knew"" something was wrong, but did nothing about it, what would that say about me?

I am SO confused, freaked out etc, because I'm not religious, I'm not spiritual, I don't believe in ANYTHING paranormal, or spirits, or the afterlife or anything of the sort, but I cant explain it. If i reach out to her, and she IS struggling deep down, even though from what I've seen she seems great, then I'm gonna mainly be sad for her obviously, but its gonna scare the shit out if me!

What should I do? Should I reach out to her, and try to find out if something major IS wrong, like I feel it is?

I don't know if I can ignore this in good conscience.

I just had the weirdest experience of my life and i need to get it off my chest. 
I was having a normal conversation with someone 
During this conversation more and more of the words the other person spoke became ""clearer"" to me. It was like i knew exactly what she was going to say before she said it. 
The further this conversation whent the more i started to ""understand"" that what ever words i used would change the outcome of the conversation, so not only was i understanding what she was going to say, i also started to understand exactly what the outcome would be by my every reply. Even further then that during this conversation i became so aware of what was going on that i had 2 strains of thought at the same time... 
I was in conversation knowing exactly what to say and knowing her replies on the one hand 
And on the other i was having a second strain of thought that was thinking about how to test if this was really happening. 

Both strains sort of twisted into one in my head and i tested it by getting her pissed off with one line and then calming her down with the next. 
Basicly we where talking about an ex boyfriend of hers and i said ""he's just acting the way he wants to cause of what happend, nothing that special about it."" I said this verry monotone cause i knew this would have the most effect and she flew off the fucking handle for a good three to four lines actually beeing mad at me. Then i followed up with. ""Do you think you could've changed the outcome of that by choosing a diffrent way of beeing, cause ill tell you if you have to change for someone..."" I stopped there had the exact tone i needed for the conversation to turn and...boom she was bitter calm again talking gently and normal... 

After about 3 minutes of that i just sort of lost that feeling

A bit of backstory, I remember something like this happening with my mom. She fell in the church parking lot but went down really slow. The ground was wet, but when she got up all her clothes were still dry.

After I told this to my father in law he said he had something similar happen where he felt like he had gone too slow during a fall.

So I was carrying our newborn in his car seat out to the car to go to our outdoor church service. I was wearing my thicker winter boots that I don't normally wear and we had a bunch of stuff in the way (bikes and scooters and what not). I stepped on a scooter and went down. My only thought was to keep the baby safe. I was holding the car seat with one hand, although I might've had two on it. It happened fast but also slow if that makes sense. There was nothing to grab to help slow my fall (was in between the cars). I took a step so I was off the scooter but I was past the point of no return and wasn't able to keep upright.

It was the most gentle fall I've ever had. I slipped on the steps recently too and kinda messed up my shoulders catching myself, but this was like...a pillow. I was able to set the car seat down without a thump and our newborn was perfectly happy, didn't cry at all and looked like he didn't even realize something had happened. I got up and my wife came out the car asking if everything was okay all in a panic (obviously) and just said, ""no...everything's fine."" kinda in a daze. Nothing hurt on me...baby was fine. I didn't even get any bruises anywhere and I bruise very easily. 

Just curious if anybody out there has had something similar happen. I could think of something helping to arrest my fall or maybe I had some adrenaline pumping (like that one crappy movie) and my reflexes got faster and I was able to set the car seat down gently while also slowing my fall my other hand being my two options as an explanation. 

At the very least I should have whacked my elbow on the ground or something that caused me pain and there's no way I should've been able to set the car seat down that gently. The first thing I remember thinking as I was laying on the ground was how much worse that could and should have been.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,938679,public,new,self,Slowly falling down,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rqevso/slowly_falling_down/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dad was born and raised in Mexico. He lived with my grandmother and his siblings. He told me that one day my uncle was walking home late one night and started hearing some strange noises. He didn’t think much of it at first and kept walking. The further he walked the more he could hear the strange noise. When he was coming up on a small bridge to get home he heard the noise even louder and clearer this time. He could hear that it was a woman, she was sobbing and saying, “Mis hijos, mis hijos!” And as many of you have guessed where this is headed, you’re about half right. My uncle walked towards the woman and asked, “Señora, estas bien?” (Miss are you ok?) there was no reply. He walked closer, to where he could touch her shoulder and saw that she wasn’t fully there, she was slightly transparent, and at that point she turns to him. My uncle described to my dad that she had the face of a horse and lunged at him. He took off running and was huffing and puffing when he got home.

Long story short, my partner and I have trust issues (when we first got together, I was very immature and stupid and made a lot of mistakes and told lies which in turn broke the trust bond between us and for a long time my partner thinks i have been cheating on him).  


On Christmas morning just recently, we were both very happy to wake up and watch our daughter open her presents, it was planned to be an awesome day and we were not expecting what would soon follow. After all the initial buzz in the morning my partner went outside for a smoke as he usually does and he finds a piece of thread (from a top i haven't worn in months, let alone worn it outside!) and my hair tie further down near the neighbours' fence. The hair tie was missing for 3 days prior i could not find it anywhere! And also the day before Chistmas we both were outside in those areas collecting washing off the line and there was absolutely nothing in either spots - we both can confirm this. So how does these two items, not just one thing but two suddenly appear overnight? My partner suspects it was me doing something dodgy outside at night when he was asleep because of the rational facts - they are items of myn and they were not there before we went to bed.  


Im putting this out there to see if anyone else has experienced something similar, things they cannot explain but that also feel like it was intentionally done to cause problems and arguments (bad spirits or entities, etc) mainly in situations involving couples.

Quite often the smoke alarm will go off and the alarm screen will say smoke is detected or something. once the code is punched in on the alarm the smoke alarm will continue to beep every few minutes or so as if there is still smoke in the air. A few things I should point out here:
This often happens in the middle of the night, 3 or 4 am usually.
No smoke has ever been present, no cooking being done at the time of the alarming happening, but it fully lets rip as if theres a raging fire.
The alarm is not battery powered, it is an electrical unit that is connected to the security alarm system. I shall reiterate, then, that the alarm does not give the typical 1 beep chirp that is the sound of a smoke alarms battery dying out, rather, it fully beep beep beeps as if it has been set off.
I'm starting to wonder if whatever ""Smoke"" is being seen / detected by the device could actually be a spirit hanging around? My house is not haunted, as far as anyone knows, though myself and a few others in the house are quite spiritual and are more opened to / willing to communicate with the other side. Could a spirit be hanging around and setting off the alarm as a way of attempted communication? Curious what you guys think. Whatever it is, its driving us nuts.

So I’ve been renting a room in a one story house for the last couple of years.

There had been a lot of strange things that would occur over the months within the house. Although I did wonder as whether to tell my Chinese landlord about it or not, I assumed she already knew as there had been prayer bells playing on repeat on radios within the house and the garage. Each one mysteriously disappearing on occasion. At first I thought it had just been my roomates becoming annoyed with the constant bells and prayers. Until I lived in the house alone, and things would mysteriously go missing. 

My boyfriend at the time returned to Taiwan for a little while. I promised him I’d keep the room for when he returned.

During some of the months I would be the only tenant in the house. All of the rooms becoming empty as time went on, only to be filled by new tenants. The house became a revolving door.

I would at times hear a little girl crying in the middle of the night. I’d smell cigar smoke when I was the only person in the home, I chalked that up as it just wafting in from the outside somewhere. But at times it was strange, unexplainable even. I would sometimes feel heat upon my face, hot almost like a flame, only moments later to smell that familiar strong cigar smoke. 

When I wasn’t alone in the house, on occasion I would hear a tenant yelling on their cellphone with the landlord on the other line. It would usually have something to do with not being told that the house was haunted. Once again I figured that she already knew.

Eventually I wanted to record my experiences in the house. Whenever I’d hear the girl crying I would try to record it, footsteps in the house and I’d open my bedroom door into the dark corridor trying to capture atleast something unexplainable that I’ve seen. So I could gather proof. 

There had been plenty of times when I opened my door to see a pale ghostly floating face, a man in his mid to early twenties and only his face staring back at me from the dark. 

Yet when I would lift my phone to record my phone would shut off as if it had no battery. There had been times when I did record or take a photo only for the photo to appear distorted or to not even be in the gallery at all. It was tricky trying to catch them but eventually I did. 

I felt quite alone in the city to be honest. I’d wake up and go to work and come back home to watch tv or Netflix. Some nights id hear my dads voice or my sisters voice coming from the hallway, telling me to let them inside. It would happen so often that I grew to ignore it. 

My cousin moved in one day, my family wanted him to come to help keep me safe. He often had a lot of things happen to him in the house, things would be thrown at him, he’d wake up with scratches and burns. While I was in the shower, at times I’d hear a woman whisper in my ear “don’t trust him” I’d turn and no one would be there. I thought I was just sleepy and I’d try to explain it off as maybe someone talking outside and it just felt like it was right up to my ear. Whatever I could to explain it. 

Later on, he proved to me that he was one of the most dangerous people in the city. Although at first I didn’t understand why he was always attacked in the house, and I guess the ghosts had been right. I made him leave.

I was once again just trying to survive on my own in the city, waiting for mark to come back. 

I would often try to stay out of the house, I would go out with friends to distract myself. Boba, food, gaming, whatever I could to just not think about waiting or the house.

I made some new friends in the city, they seemed nice at first. Until I realized it was simply a facade. Most people are nice and I often try to see the good in people. But given I was a female alone in the city I should have been more careful. 

This part of the story ties into the current goings on within the house.

As the months went on I bought a spirit box, I would ask questions and they would answer. At one time I asked “where is mark?” Just to see if they knew, and they responded accurately “with his squad”. I would talk to them like I would with normal people. I respected them and in some way it made me feel less alone until I turned it off. Still being careful about it, for months I wouldn’t talk to them. 

Mark told me not to talk to the spirits, given an experience we had in an apartment a few years ago. My family and his family say that I have a gift, just like my mom and Dad. But I never really knew my mom. 

I would often come home, and if something bad happened that day it was like they already knew. Things in the room would be thrown, the lights would turn off on their own. Sometimes I would go through my room trying to find something. I’d lay on the bed and just close my eyes giving up on trying to find it and I’d feel a pressure on my stomach. As if something fell on me from the ceiling, only to look down and whatever I was looking for was right there. It happened quite often. 

One day when my spirit box was broken, I laid in bed just thinking. The overhead light in the room turned off and I was laying in the pitch black room, only my solar panel lights remaining on. I picked up my phone and started to record. 

I asked them “are you there?” And the light turned on in the closet and then back off. I began to ask them about my new friends and it was like they already knew. The light would turn on for yes and remain off for no. 

In the end I asked them “do we get along?” And the light turned on, it remained on for the rest of the night. 

I was quite upset with those new friends for a little while. When mark returned, he and the landlord took me to a temple after I explained some of the spirits I had seen and described them to them. The landlord confirmed that she knew the house was haunted. We went to the temple to meet with a monk she trusted. 

Although he didn’t know what we discussed he had described the spirits in the same way I described them to her. Mark and my landlord looked over at me with astonishment after receiving a confirmation. 

The ghosts..
A man who was hung
A little girl
A little boy
A young man who died in a car accident
A tall shadow
A weeping woman in a white dress
He confirmed it all. Then the landord asked them to remove the spirits from the home. They later came to the home. And although I am sad they will be gone… i am happy they’re able to be free.

I think the little girl and the boy are still here with the shadow and the young man.  I can still hear her crying at night sometimes. 

The monk later told the landlord, they won’t leave until “she” does. He also told her that I am close to the spirit world, and removing me could anger them. 

And so here I am… still in this room. And nothing bad has happened to mark or I. It’s just nice knowing, we’re not entirely alone.

I’ve been dealing with a lot of health problems as a result of some sort of adverse cardiac reaction to the moderna vaccine that has been plaguing me for the past 4 months now. I’ve been in the care of a cardiologist who has been taking good care of me. 

The short of it is that one night I dreamt that I urgently needed him and called his office, only to be told by the receptionist that he no longer worked there as he had recently retired. I woke up and questioned for a moment whether or not that was real, and then quickly pieced together it was just a dream.

About a week later my cardiologist called me to follow up on some tests, and ended the conversation by letting me know that he was retiring at the end of the year. My jaw dropped and I had such a bizarre feeling from it.

The man is, young, late 50s at worst, and there was no way for me to have known he would have been retiring.

In short, I was going through an extremely difficult year for my mental health. I was sitting in my late class (6:30 PM ish) and was starring out the window during lecture. It was a slightly foggy winter evening and it had just started to snow lightly. I remember feeling an extreme calm come over me. Now understand, I was living in a time when my own brain was tormenting me- it was not a normal feeling. In fact, on my most relaxing and peaceful days I have never felt that. So as I left class and started the long walk across campus, it seemed as though time slowed down and that everything got much quieter. I noticed that I could see with more clarity. I swear it was like I could see all the minor details of the campus architecture and the pathway texture. In a time of utter depression, it was extremely enjoyable. Once I got in my car and drove away, the feeling stopped. I always wondered if I had fatigued myself to a point where I entered fight or flight and maybe resulted in a complete altercation of my physiological state. I always figured it was some psychological phenomenon. I wasn’t very spiritual. Flash forward to tonight. 

I am much happier now but I will admit today was arguably the worst I’ve had in a while- just a lot of career contemplations and anxiety lately. I was having a normal evening at my girlfriends, and then I drove home. I noticed it was fairly foggy once I reached the city overpass that cuts over the harbor. I was blasting music and driving faster than I should have. That is to say that I was far from relaxed. But then in the matter of seconds I felt it again, I knew I was because it immediately crossed from my subconscious mind. I recognized the feeling. As I was taking the loop exit towards my home, I swear it felt the same as the first time- it seemed slow, still, and quiet. I was watching the detail of the asphalt while I was turning my car around the sheer bend. It felt like a whole minute. I’m much more spiritual now and have actually talked with my girlfriend about the previous time this happened. It seems so supernatural to me, as if I’m being surrounded and like there’s an attempt to give me a message of some kind of wake up call. 

It could be nothing, but its a feeling so serene that i have actually gotten emotional wishing that I could feel it again.

so tonight a few friends and i decided to play with our oujia board. not our first time and we have contacted spirits before. personally, i don’t believe in the paranormal as much as i’d like to. im just pretty skeptical with anything that doesn’t have hard proof. even after tonight i still don’t know what i believe. 

anyway, we’re playing and instantly get a contact. we end up talking to her for almost two hours and learn quite a few things: 

- female 
- name: gia d.
- born 1938 
- died 1956 
- born and raised in utah 
- hispanic 
- 5’10 , 96 lbs 
- had first suicide attempt, overdose, when she was 14 
- second fatal attempt, slitting wrists, when she was 18
- she was in a foster home her entire life with over forty other kids and was neglected her entire life due to her race, weight, and height
- she said her caretakers didn’t feed her because of her race 
- she was bullied a lot for the same things 

now the entire time we were talking to her she was very fixated on me in particular. she said that she was my guardian angel and that she was watching over me because of my “mental illness” and because of “how sad i am.” i asked if there was any way she could make herself known to me, she told she’s visited me before in my dreams, that she is disguised as nature and hands (?), this is something she told me a lot, that i would find her in my dreams. she also made sure to continually tell me that she’s my protector, that she’s here to protect me. 


we asked her many questions on where and how we could find her. a lot of them to which she replied with “can’t say” but she did tell us that she is buried in a cemetery and she has a headstone.

she also kept saying things like “find me” (she said this a lot) and we’d ask her what she would do if we found her, she’d reply, “free u.” to that we’d ask, “free us from what” and she’d always reply with “sad.”

i do have a few more minuscule details about this occurrence, and can tell anyone who is interested or thinks they can be of any help! again, not quite sure if i believe in superstitious things like this, but i do feel like we did contact someone. 

i feel like she was a good spirit and i was actually glad to talk to her. but i have no knowledge on anything paranormal and can’t be sure on anything. again, any input would be amazing!!

The curtain was closed and I couldn’t make out anything what she was saying, but I heard the whispering go on for maybe 20 seconds.

I had tried calling her multiple times that day and never got ahold of her so I asked a friend to stop by her house and check on her. She was throwing up and talking about how my (deceased) grandfather wouldn't come in the house from the garage to help her shower and her (deceased) mother was just sitting on the couch ignoring her. Turns out she was in septic shock so the delusions make sense. (She's doing much better now by the way!)

My father is at her house after spending time with her at the hospital and is sending me the list of her medications while standing in the kitchen; the backdoor opens to the kitchen area. He very obviously hears the screen to the backdoor open and turns his head expecting to see me or the friend who checked on my grandmother earlier in the day opening the back door. But no one opens the door and he never hears the screen door close. Thirty seconds go by and he decides to pop his head outside. The only thing he sees is a car parked at the stop sign on the side road 300 yards away that just sat there for a few minutes. The car then makes a u-turn to go back down the lake road (dead end) where they had come from, but while doing so pauses when the headlights were facing my grandmother's house for 30 seconds. So did someone run up to the house and open the back door from this car and the car was waiting on them and looking for them with the headlights?

Even after hearing this, I decide to stay the night to take care of my grandmother's cat while she's in the hospital. I clearly remember before bed her walker being in the bathroom where she always keeps it to help her take a shower. When I woke up in the morning, the walker was in the MIDDLE of the kitchen.

So is my grandfather looking for my grandmother? What explanations do you guys have for these stories because we're at a loss.

This however, while explainable, still haunts me; I saw the Old Hag during my one and only sleep paralysis.

This was just a couple of years ago. I was married at the time and in bed with my now ex-wife. I never sleep on my back and I don't suffer from sleep paralysis. But that morning, while it was still pitch black outside, I woke up and this woman thing was on top of me. For some reason I was on my back and I wasn't able to breath.

What's horrifying and that I can still remember til this day was the thing itself. I remember it. Almost clearly but not clearly. For some reason I imagine it's face having both empty black eye sockets but also completely covered eye sockets with melded skin. It's skin was a grayish color and I can't fully remember it's mouth but it I remember it had some messed up one. It was a woman. I remember that it was screaming something at me and was just inches from my face, but can't remember what. It's like I can remember the details super clearly but not at all.

I could swear on everything that when I snapped out of it my ex wife was sitting up with her hand covering my mouth and smothering me. That she just stopped and laid back down. And I immediately confronted her about it. And she swore up and down, and swore for years til the point of accusing me of gaslighting, that she never did that.

It's never happened again. Not sleep paralysis. Not any of it. I had heard of Old Hag syndrome before and always wrote it off as a joke. Then that happened to me and it messed with me badly.

It was maybe a week ago that I looked into the darkness of my room and saw what seemed to be a very, very, tall skinny shadow. I probably stared at it for about one or two seconds before I turned around and got under my blankets.

I know I was fully awake. I was fully aware of my surroundings. I usually look into the dark at least once a night just to make sure nothing is watching me, lol.

So, ever since this happened, I have been fully avoiding looking into the dark when I wake up in the middle of the night. 

Anyways, on Christmas day at around 4 am, I had a nightmare that I was sleeping with my back facing the darkness of my room, and a demon was tapping on my back with pointy fingers. I did not know that it was a dream, it was hyperrealistic. I usually am always aware that I am dreaming when I dream, I guess they are usually lucid. But this one wasn't. I woke up from this dream, was a little scared but too tired to care, and I fell back asleep. Then, I had another dream that I was still laying there in the same position, and this time a demon was singing a song and i was singing along with it. I called out to my (dead) dad, and then my dog flew into my bed and jumped onto me. She had red eyes...

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up a little startled because the dog thing was really out of nowhere. I lay there not sure what to do and then turned on my flashlight so I could browse my phone without seeing any shadow people. lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am now realizing that all of this happened AFTER I saged my house. I did not have any windows open as I saged. My room has plenty of crystals in it, but the shadow was not near them. 

Yeah. I don't know. Maybe I should sage again, but do it with more effort?

Last night scared me

I live in an historic apartment building built in 1927. I’ve been here about six months and nothing too creepy has happened except for a few instances. 

First, a few months ago I saw on tik tok a “ghost communicator app” and I downloaded it to use with my friend here. I had it opened for 10 seconds, still in the middle of a conversation with my friend, when the app called out the full name of my friend. Never in my life have I ever called her that and I got creeped out and immediately deleted the app

This morning I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or had sleep paralysis. I was lying on my stomach and I felt a heavy presence sit on my bed next to me. I also remember looking at the spot but I didn’t see a figure or anything. I don’t know if I went back to sleep or this happened right after, but something then was forcing and holding down my wrists as I was laying on my stomach. I think my torso was also weighed down and I remember thinking “get off me. Get off me” and knowing that I couldn’t move 

Idk if this is something I just shouldn’t be thinking about and putting my energy towards but I don’t want to feel anxious in my home.

The first ""paranormal"" experience I had was back when my age was in the single digits, around 7-8 years old. I grew up in the Midwest, Ohio to be more specific. The town (village as we grew up calling it) was not large by any means, around 40-50 people at the most. During this time my family didn't have the internet, or cable TV. Cell phones were just starting to become mainstream (Mid 90's era) and as such entertainment was mostly chores or roaming the surrounding area exploring.

My house was backed by fairly dense woods, there was a steep decline with a relatively flat wooded area where a creek ran through. This creek wasn't very deep (waist deep in certain areas but mostly knee or ankle deep) but it was wide. Growing up I lived in those woods, hiking up and down the creek, mapping the woods, exploring a few long abandoned and collapsed houses that nature reclaimed. I lived and breathed nature and those woods were my home away from home.

My father grew up in that area, my aunt, uncle, and cousins lived just next door and it was a pretty close knit community. Naturally everyone has ""ghost"" stories about their home town, a haunted house, a tragedy of some sort that remains a stain on its history. My village was no different, my father would always tell stories about ghosts or abnormal happenings he experienced in his youth. One thing he would always tell me when I told him I was going into the woods was ""the trees may not walk about or talk, but they do see and remember."" I always thought of that as him saying don't be stupid out there.

My first encounter with the people of the woods, which is what I always called them was when I was on one of my daily excursions into the the wild green. It was mid July and it was hot and humid, I stuck mostly to the creek as it was cool, and I didn't have to battle my way through thick undergrowth. I hiked approximately about two miles along the creek hunting for crawdads (crawfish) and looking for signs of deer, rabbit or the fabled albino squirrel.

I kept traveling and eventually arrived at a relatively open field that had waist high grass, and I frequently stopped here to gather wild black berries, rest, and spook the few white tailed deer bedded in the area. But that day was different. As I drew closer to the field I noticed someone standing in the field. Instinctively I slowed down lowered my posture and tried to minimize my noise. I wasn't used to seeing someone out this far into the woods. The nearest house to that location was about a mile and a half through thick undergrowth and fairly steep ravines to climb.

As I hugged the bank of the creek I moved to the edge of the open field slowly peeking up over the tall grass to see if they were still there. Nothing. I thought that perhaps they seen or heard me trudging through the creek and Instinctively ducked too. I wasn't about to find out so I turned around and headed back home, all 2 and a half miles back. I was more aware of my surroundings and far more cautious of my sound as I moved. Avoiding walking in the creek to prevent the sloshing of water to give me away. As I crept through the branches jutting out into the bank of the creek I made my way to another area I was familiar with. A small game trail ran through here and it would cut my time and distance back home a good bit. The only downside was it was pretty overgrown to either side and portions had thick thorn bushes.

The entire time I trekked back I felt as if I'm being watched, I never felt in danger or vulnerable of being attacked but I could feel eyes on me. I was uneasy the entire time I followed the game trail, routinely stopping and listening to determine if I could hear foot steps or if I was being followed. Still, nothing. I made it about halfway back home when I seen in the corner of my eyes a figure standing a short distance away, but as I moved my eyes in the direction of the figure they seemed to just meld into the foliage. I thought maybe my paranoia was making me see things so I just continued on.

A few hundred feet more I again seen another figure this time further away out of my peripheral, and again as I looked in that direction they'd meld back into the background. But this time it happened twice, as I looked and that figure disappeared another appeared again in my peripherals closer but still a ways away. The entire time I never felt to be in danger, creeped out yes but I never felt like whatever was there was nefarious in intent. This continued on for the remainder of my time making my way back home but the more it happened the less I acknowledged it, even going as far as saying out loud ""I know you're there, I don't know what you want but I'm not here to cause trouble"". Eventually I made it back to my back yard and I turned around to face the woods to see if they were there, but nothing was there. 

My father was next to his shed burning some cut grass in the backyard. I walked over to him to tell him what I experienced and before I could say a word he looked at me and with a slight grin said ""I see you saw them too."" I guess I had the look of terror written on my face. Without even missing a beat he put down the hoe he was using to stoke the fire, walked past me to the woodline and pulled out the can of dip he had in his pocket. He opened it, took a pinch out and placed it on a stone that was jutting out from the ground and walked back. I asked what he did and he said he gave them an offering. He began explaining what he meant by the trees see and remember, that it was important that we respect nature whenever we enter her domain and give an offering in return when we take things from her. Otherwise she just may not let us back out.

He gave me the can of dip and said what I saw were what he believed were spirits of Native Americans keeping watch over their former land. I didn't really know what they were at the time, but I followed suit with what my dad did whenever I made my way back into the woods. I always left an offering, and although I still did see them from time to time I never felt like I was ever in danger, and I always made sure to respect them. If they appeared in my peripherals I would travel in the opposite direction apologizing for any transgressions.

My cousins and many people in my village all were aware of their existence and just kinda gave them a wide berth whenever they appeared. I was oblivious to their existence but when I learned of them and experienced them a whole lot of people opened up about them, about some of the history of the town.

My family (mother and brother) and I have lived in this house for around 11 years, there have always been various kinds of strange activity. But now I'm just going to talk about what could be appearances by doppelgängers. The first time it happened, my mother was alone in the house, my brother and I were at my aunt's house. My mother says that she clearly heard how my brother and I entered the house talking and she from her room greeted us aloud, when she saw that neither of us answered her, she went to the living room where she thought we would be and found the house empty, minutes later my brother and I got home and found her shocked.

The second time it happened to my brother, he was with my mother at home while I was in college, he says he came home from work and when he entered the house he saw me sitting on the living room couch and said to tome ""you left early?"" As he walked to his room, when he saw that I did not answer him, he returned and saw that there was no one there.

The third time it happened to me. It was just my mom and I in the house, I was in the living room watching a movie and she was in her room. I fell asleep on the couch while watching the movie, I woke up because I heard my mom's hair dryer, I turned off the TV and walked towards my room, I passed the bathroom and saw my mom drying her hair, normal, I did not give much importance. While lying on my bed I thought about ordering something for dinner so I went to look for my mother to see if she wanted something for dinner too, so I went to the bathroom where I had seen her and she was not there, so I went to her room and I was surprised that he was not there either. I looked around the house and didn't see her, like it was a few minutes difference between when I saw her drying her hair and when I entered my room. I called her on her cell  to ask her where she was and her response was that she had left the house an hour ago, she saw me asleep and did not want to wake me up to let me know that she was going out.

Things like that have been happening for the almost 11 years that we have been living in this house, we always see one of us when that person is not in the house.
We have heard that my mom speaks to us when she is not there or they have heard my voice or my brother's and it's not like we see them with the corner of our eye, we have seen them directly as a real person.

I would like to know if you have been through this, what could I do so that it does not happen again or if there is an explanation for all this.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,938330,public,new,self,I think there are doppelgängers in my house.

When we drove past a parking lot on the side of the mountain road, I heard a man's voice saying, ""excuse me?"" The voice sounded, sort of, devoid of energy, or souless, yet it was so clear. 

It sounded so lifeless that I got the impression that he was injured and asking for help, but at the same time, it sounded like my brain had tricked my ears, so I ignored it. 

In Japan, we call it ""sky ear"" when you hear things that aren't there. So, about 5 seconds after hearing the voice, I told my family: ""I just heard sky ear."" 

My brother said, ""me too."" My father who was driving, looked back and said: ""someone said, 'excuse me?' Right?"" My brother then responded, ""I heard, 'help me...'"" 

My father took a u-turn and drove back to the parking lot. He parked on the side of the parking lot, got out with my brother, and started looking for the person. There were a few cars parked, so they were even looking under those cars. 

My mother who was sitting behind me, was confused, because she had not heard the voice at all. At this point, we didn't even think it was anything paranormal; we were concerned that there may be someone injured or dying. 

But while waiting in the car, both my mother and I suddenly started feeling spooked out. My mother was especially freaking out, saying; ""I'm feeling really scared, all of a sudden."" 

My father and brother then came back into the car, looking confused. My father kept saying that it was surreal, because they went to see if there was anywhere the person could have gone to, but there was no path behind the parking lot (it was sort of a steep cliff), and there was no soul in any of the cars or down the cliff. 

I still remember what the voice sounded like. It was an adult male voice, and it sounded so flat and monotonous that you would think whoever said wasn't ""quite alive.""

I’m currently 24, I live in Oklahoma, close too Tulsa in a small suburban neighborhood. Things got bad a couple years back, a few weeks before moving in with my current gf. Things seem too be going alright at the time, however something happened that sent chills down my spine, my dad was renting my room out too a girl I use too go to school with, so I had been sleeping on the couch at the time. While I was laying down trying too sleep, something was outside clawing on the bricks on the other side of the wall from the couch. I ignored it and was able too fall asleep. Months later after moving in with my gf things got more disturbing. One night I had gone out for a pop and I heard a child crying quite loudly, it was coming from the atttic. I almost went up too check it out but my gut feeling told me too get down and run. So I did exactly that. I stopped going out too the garage late at night. However a few weeks later, I wanted too smoke so I went out there late at night. I saw a pale naked and skinny person jump down from the attic right in front of me. I only saw it’s backside. I was filled with fear and shock. I ended up running inside and locking the door behind me. Months later I moved out and back into my dads place. This happened the first month of being back, I went out too smoke late at night in the garage. As I was sitting down, I heard extremely loud clawing coming from the back of the house, I heard it climb up onto the house aI heard foot steps moving towards me from the roof top, till it was right above me, then it just started tapping, I was pretty freaked out and went back inside. It followed me there and back. It’s been about 5-6 months since then and things have mostly chilled out, but I recently had a extremely vivid nightmare and it came after me and got me. The tapping on the wall has started back up again, sometimes it comes from the attic. Something doesn’t feel right as of lately and I’m starting worry that it’s still following me and that my life could be at risk.

Before I would just read random movie subreddits &amp; mainly MMA subreddit.  I was mainly looking for doppelgänger related stories &amp; I found the Elevator Game ritual posts.  I never did it but my interest was peaked.  The energy I got from just reading it was creepy.  I then found the Three Kings subreddit &amp; read the rituals there.  Again, never did any of them.  I’m fairly spiritual, know about channeling &amp; wear crystals &amp; gems.  I know about the paranormal but do not actively seek it out.  Mostly an open-minded &amp; positive person.  I meditate.  Don’t drink or do any drugs.

I was working as a slot attendant at this time from 4pm - 12am.  One day going to work I step out the main door of my apartment complex to to my car.  Immediately, on the sidewalk leading out the door - there was a chalk drawing of hopscotch squares w/ numbers but the interesting thing was the numbers were that from the Elevator Game ritual &amp; at top of the hopscotch square was a stick figure trying to get to a star.  I’m thinking OK - interesting but I will not be afraid.  Then at work I have to carry a radio &amp; keys to help people w/ jammed tickets &amp; money.  I was in the middle of the casino when I get called by one of security guards to come to a slot machine by the cashier window.  I acknowledge &amp; make my way.  While at the machine which was a multi-game touch screen where you can select different games.  The customer had a ticket jammed which was an easy fix.  On the screen was a game called Three Kings.  I laughed in my mind but I knew something is up.  

Then at home while sleeping I got visited by 3 witches that came out of my top bed frame.  Two of them sat by my lower left bed while the third one sat on my chest &amp; bounced up &amp; down.  Then outside my window I would see shadows move about.  It was around May 2019 &amp; I thinking it’s only the spring breeze but what made it bizarre was a wind blowing on top of my window but the sound was that of a male spirit.  It was a protecting energy.  This was after the 3 witches visiting me.  It made a Woo-woo sound.  It lasted for 3 months &amp; I realized it was protecting my apartment as I asked for protection from my Spirit Family.  

Then another time at work I was by the blackjack tables &amp; my radio did a static noise - it was a weird noise.  There were people close &amp; such but I got weird’d out by it.  I asked another slot attendant who close by if he heard the weird static noise?  He said no.  After a bit I decided to go take a break &amp; I decided to go the mens locker room as the break room was full of people.  The locker room itself is small.  You walk in there is a wall, you have to walk left then there is a big locker to put your dirty uniform then you have to turn right &amp; there are the lockers &amp; a small bench.  In the back was the bathroom.  That’s it.  So, while I was on the bench on my phone facing the front way - I hear that weird static noise on my radio.  Then I felt a girl spirit in the bathroom like she got teleported there.  She didn’t seem friendly.  I got up w/ the quickness &amp; bolted out the locker room.

There are few more creepy stuff that happened but I wanted to share these first few.  Basically from reading the Elevator Game ritual.  Sounds dumb &amp; trivia but this was what happened to me.

This aside, I've been having other coincidences like finding white feathers, animals in random places (specially bees) being placed in my hand or other occurrences also with pigeons. 


I've been praying consistently and asked Jesus during prayer if he could stop it if it was not from him, yet they haven't stopped. During prayer I've been having a lot of ""burning"" during it. The best way to describe it is intense heat as well as feeling like my heart is being touched.

on top of all for this past two years I've been having biblical dreams but there are two that quite stand out: One dream about the rapture back in late 2019 and a dream with a demon back in early 2021.

1st dream: The whole sky was filled with dark thick clouds which covered all the city in which I was in. My feet were on the roof of my apartment building and I was looking up as the wind was blowing in a non inviting fashion — I felt fear and wonder at the same time. The sky opens and there's a big cross on the sky which poured an insane amount of light, almost as of the sky was splitting to form that form. There was not a single sound in the city, it was just me dumbfounded looking up with intense fear.
This one dream was in November of 2019.

2nd dream: It all started in a park where I was hanging out with my friends and it seemed that we were drinking. After a while being there, I saw this regular person - same as any other - come into the friend group and start talking with everybody. He was so damn charismatic. Then, we all go home and I return to my apartment. Here, I live with this one real beautiful girl, yet I know she's not real; I know she's an android and nothing more than smoothed metal just for my eyes to see and my mouth to drool. Despite all this, she was cold yet she seemed to be my only company at the time.

I go into my room and out of nowhere I get a flashback in my dream which projected me into an era from long ago. My sight witnessed kings, queens and powerful people from back many milenia, centuries, decades and later years ago. All of them seemed to ""connect"" with this atrocious being which looked like the merge between a bug and a human with melted flesh. As this happened, strings were created on them leading to this one hideous thing. The memories from time ago faded I was left in my room again. Less than a minute passed till, in the dream, time stopped. 
I could move, but everything in the room came to a ""stop"".

As I turn my back and I see this one thing. The thing is right next to me. If decadence married malevolence this would have been it's offspring. As time froze up first I came second, but not for too long. I became more aware of ""my dream"" and screamed the name of Jesus Christ and this thing flew away - in a ghostly fashion - from my room. As I saw it running, I chased it to this one apartment in my building and I opened the door: The same charismatic guy was inside!
As I saw him, I knew that ""thing"" was either inside of him or was disguised at him. I said the name of Jesus once again and the thing burned like no other.
This dream happened along June of this year.

We call me jinns. 

Anyways, I'm wondering where and if I should post it. We moved houses after our old house toilet floor collapsed into our downstairs dining area, my mum and family are taking turns going back and forty cleaning and sorting it out as best as we can so the landlord can give it away to someone else. 

Anyways, yesterday I had to help...I took a video of the street area and it continued on as I went further in the house for future memories and stuff. I went into the kitchen area and then heard a high pitched voice call my name. Sounded nothing like my mum and she wasn't even close to me. Although it sounds neutral and echoey in the video, in real life as soon as I heard my name I got dizzy and overwhelmed with fear. I knew it was jinn. I quickly put some Qur'an on and played it off forgetting it was on video. 

I found the video again this morning and heard it through there so I know it wasn't my imagination. 

There's no other explanation. But just to add on. I've often felt scared and experienced other paranormal stuff in that house including seeing shadow figures slide from one wall to another. A tall woman wearing a black cloak walk past my door (thought it was family but was told my family members left hours earlier) and I've seen things move on its own. 

Some family speculate black magic was done on that house, I think the jinns are just bored and want to live there. 

Should I post it? Mind you if I do share it I can't show everything for privacy reasons (some people may know who I am, I have family using this app) and I'll show a snippet of the audio part. 

I described it to family as it sounding like how a cartoon would speak like.

We decided to go to a smaller graveyard way out of town, maybe 20 miles or so. He wanted to go to his uncle's(?) gravestone and try to talk to him. We attempted to contact his uncle's(?) We of course wouldn't trust any spirit talking to us, and we didn't. So we do what we wished, and get ready to go.  


Start the truck, put into drive. It doesn't go into drive, and is not shifting anywhere out of park. Mind you this is near \~2:00 AM or so. We don't think much about it, and go about trying to diagnose the issue with the truck, without finding any issues. At this point, the spirits in the graveyard are mostly leaving us alone. We called our buddy who was near 40 miles out from us to pick us up. We both suddenly get an earie feeling, and almost can see all of these spirits in this graveyard start circling us. This is the first time I've really felt genuine fear about spirits. Their energy was radiating negativity, and was feeling as if it was growing and growing.  


Our friend thank the lords picked us up before 3:00 AM hit. I would not want to know what would have happened or what we would have seen if we would have been left there for 15 minutes longer as the clock hit 3. We ended  up getting the truck towed to a mechanic, which said the damage on the line going to the transmission had damage he had not seen before. Not normal wear and tear or anything that should normally happen, and this truck was working completely fine just before.  


I hope this sends a message to some people wanting to mess around in graveyards at night, please don't. There was something that was wanting us to stay longer until 3 AM hit.

(This was a luxury car,  bought new and was less than a year old, so I was really taken back. My wife was freaking out.)

AAA arrives and tests the battery. It's dead. He goes to remove it and the battery connectors just crumble because they are so corroded.  Says he's never seen connectors that bad. He went to work on the car and I went back into the museum to apologize to Robert. 

The museum staff wasn't surprised at all about the situation. ""Happens all the time."".

She hated her mother-in-law. My paternal grandpa was an awesome guy: WWII army medic, raised eight kids, *loved* fishing, and was absolutely thrilled when my brother and I (his first two grandkids) were born. 

On Thanksgiving 1988, my Grandpa wasn't his usual, jovial self. Sure, he was happy--but he seemed tired. I had just turned one, so clearly I have no recollection of his demeanor this day, but my family says he was off. Grandpa never said the words, ""Goodbye"" when it came time to part. He was fond of, ""See yas later!"", or ""Alright yas guys, get home safe!"" Apparently, it was just his thing. 

When we were leaving my grandparent's house that Thanksgiving night, my mom was the last to walk out. After asking Grandpa if he was okay, if he needed anything, etc., he just kept brushing her off, saying that he was tired and just needed some rest--that's all. It'll be fine. Then, he hugged my mom and said, ""Goodbye, Susan.""

When my mom came to the car, she told my dad. My dad said that his father was fine. He needed rest and not to worry. Everything was fine.

The next day my grandpa died of a massive heart attack. 

Fast forward 31 years. My mom told me this story so many times, and reminded me that if anybody ever says goodbye in a weird way--yknow, not their usual way--remember it. It might be the last time you see them. I always kept this in the back of my head. 

I went to visit my mom one Sunday. It was a short visit, but little did I know it would be my last visit. My mom had this little routine of saying goodbye to me: when I drove away she would stand in the driveway and wave until my car disappeared. I would wave back until I turned the corner. If it was winter, she would stand in the window with the lights illuminating her, waving until I couldn't see her anymore. 

That day when it was time for me to leave and we said our goodbyes, I got my car and I looked back--she had walked immediately inside. She did stand in the driveway. She didn't stand in the window to wave. She wasn't waving at all. As I drove away, I felt sad and audibly said to myself, ""Aw, I truly hope this isn't the last time I see her..."".

(Side note: I do not have schizophrenia or anything other than poor sleep and too much sugar to explain this.)

One night, I was trying to get to sleep and as I was struggling to drift off, I heard a voice in my head. Again, keep in mind, I also hadn’t slept in over 24 hours and I believe I also had eaten a lot of candy or something that night. 

However, this still has never happened again under the same circumstances or in general. Besides, I think people who have experienced paranormal phenomenons can recognize a certain vibe that signals the presence of… well, a presence.

The voice was of a man and he was telling me how her died and that they rolled him up in a carpet and threw him in the river to be carried away or something. I don’t remember all the details because this was probably along the the age of 9-11, I’m not awfully certain.

Then a bunch of other voices filled my head telling me about how they died, how they were disposed of if they were murdered or maybe they were just blabbing at some point because I couldn’t properly make out what they were saying because it was like and echo chamber.

Then I open my eyes instinctively to see a ghoulish green face in front of me with a creepy smile and wide eyes (I kinda forget what the eyes were like and if they were hollow or also a glowing green) It was as if it was glowing. The face quickly faded into the darkness after I had caught a glance at it.

Maybe it was just the circumstances of the situation mixed with an overactive imagination and a side of insomnia. Maybe all these details describe previously recorded encounters with certain cryptis/apparitions/beings/presences or whatever.

Anyway, I was taking my dog out for one last ditch effort at getting her to pee before bed. About four houses down from the patch of grass we were in, I saw two green glowing eyes close to the ground. I know cats eyes glow green at night when hit with a light. But it’s eyes glowed green consistently and it seemed to be turning its head in weird ways. The only lights in our neighborhood are street lights and when it turned it’s head away from the lights, the eye shine didn’t falter. They just kept glowing.

I started to feel uneasy so I was walking her back toward our apartment when I turned around and saw the glowing green eyes were about four feet above the ground and the mass they were attached to was quickly moving our direction.

I picked my dog up and ran into the apartment which woke my boyfriend up. He doesn’t believe I saw anything weird. But I definitely did. I googled nocturnal animal eye shine colors and no animals that stand four feet off the ground and live in the city have green eye shine. Coyotes and dogs have red eye shine.

It leaned over the bed as though checking the sheets, then stood up again and walked to the bottom of the bed ...at this point I'm going crazy shouting ""turn on your light!"" As this thing starts crawling up the bed towards me!

I have told this story to a few people and they always share these really ridiculous stories in return that just make me sigh.

I would be a skeptic. I want to be a skeptic. But this one event in my life makes me believe ghosts are real. This happened in 2005. I'm 29 now in 2021. Two events happened in the same day and never happened again. Other things have happened in my life, but I had explanations for them. This, though, I never figured out an explanation for.

The first happened in the morning. I was laying in bed. It was a little chilly but not really. Suddenly I heard little footsteps like a kid running through the halls. I got scared and threw my covers over me. The footsteps ran clearly into my room all the way beside me and stopped. And I got really, really hot. It felt like the ink they put inside you during a MRI. I was scared and I actually don't remember what I did immediately after. I just know I didn't take the covers off til the heat was gone.

The second was in the same day. My mom's house was huge. Just one of her living rooms was the size of a typical suburban home. I was all the way at the literal opposite corner of the house sitting in a recliner and playing Soul Calibur 3 on PS2. I heard the footsteps running through the house and they got all the way beside me and just stopped. There was no one there. I got that really hot feeling again, so I jumped up and yelled ""leave me alone."" Then I bolted all the way through the house to my Mom's bedroom. I tried to tell her what happened but she was ditzy about it.

It never happened again. I've spent my entire life trying to explain it, but I haven't been able to. It wasn't the house settling. The footsteps were 100% clear to me. The heat was had no source. A lot of the typical things people say like ""inaudible frequencies"" I've 95% certain I've debunked in this case due to how far away and how long apart each event was from eachother.

The house was built in the 1970s, and we don’t know much about its history.  I have been a frequent reader of this subreddit and thought that the experiences I had were only wishful thinking, a subconscious desire to want supernatural things to happen because I’ve enjoyed the stories I’ve read here.  But then my wife and sister-in-law have also experienced things.  Is this our imagination, or is something really happening? I have no desire to lie for Reddit upvotes, so I am trying to be as honest as possible about what we’ve experienced.  Here’s what I have: 

1. Around six months ago, my wife had a migraine and saw a woman with blonde-gray hair walking out of our guest room at the end of the hall into the bathroom.  We explained it away as a migraine hallucination.

2. I am a sleepwalker, but I usually remember what happens during my episodes.  One night while sleepwalking, I opened the bedroom door and distinctly remember a woman in a white dress with blond-gray hair standing in the doorway.  I remember walking around her.  It actually didn’t freak me out at the time, but did the next morning when I thought about it.  Before I told my wife, I asked her to describe the woman she saw.  It was the description of the same woman I saw:  blond-gray shoulder-length hair in a white dress.  Maybe around 50 years old.  I didn’t know what the woman she saw looked like before I had my experience.

3. Occasionally, late at night, I will hear what sounds like someone blowing their nose in the hallway.  I always assumed it was my sister-in-law in the nearby room.  Last week, I was in the kitchen and my wife was coming out of the bathroom.  She said my name.  I replied, and she said she wanted to make sure I still in the kitchen:  from the guest room next to the bathroom (the same room the lady walked out from) she heard what sounded like someone blowing their nose in the room behind that closed door.  No one was in there.

4. The entrance to the attic is in the hallway.  A couple of weeks ago, we found the entrance in the ceiling pushed up and moved over.  It was a windy day, so we assumed it was the force of the wind when we opened the front door.  It was still windy outside, but we weren’t able to reproduce this.  To get access, you would have to push it straight up around three or four inches and move it over.  It is also a few pounds, and not something easy to move.  Maybe it was just the wind?

5. Late at night we often hear footsteps in the attic and sometimes scratching sounds.  There are no raccoons or anything up there.  Every time we check, it looks empty, also with no signs of damage that you would expect from animals.  There also appears to be no damage or entry point from the outside.  On the day the entrance moved, I was home all day.  I didn’t remember hearing coming from the attic.

6. My sister-in-law hears footsteps on the steps going down into our basement every now and then.  The stairs are near where I saw the woman in my sleepwalking, also not far from the attic entrance in the ceiling.  She has also heard people talking in the basement.  All televisions and computers were turned off each time.

This all seems circumstantial when taken individually, but altogether seems to paint a picture.  The ghost, if there is one, doesn’t seem malevolent.  We don’t get any bad feelings or experiences of dread.  Yet there seems to be a presence.  Or maybe we are just crazy?

One of my residents passed a while ago (months), and it was not an easy go. She was in pain and lingered longer than necessary.

When she passed she was a shell of her former self and was so frail and stiff from not being able to move (she had broken her hips previously to her decline and couldn't be rotated). 

I had a dream just after the holidays of working in the facility (but a different building shape) and walking down the hall with another worker (a face I didnt recognize but it was someone else in scrubs). 

We turned down the hall and I saw my resident sitting in a wheelchair and smiling at me. She was so real and bright, as if she had light from within her that had added a glow to her entire body. Her face was so realistic and it was vibrant. She looked healthy and happy, she was full of laughter and joy. 

I knew in my dream that she was dead. There was no questions in my mind when I saw her if she was supposed to be there. I knew she wasn't and that she had died months ago.

I asked my coworker if she saw a woman sitting in a wheelchair at the end of the hall and she said ""no"". I hurried is passed my deceased resident and that was the end of it.

There’s usually a variety of good advice given in response. I’ve used most of them and finally settled on the one I’m going to share. 

It’s simple, extremely effective, doesn’t require anything, can be used at any time and in any place, and performed in just a few seconds once it has been memorized. 

It’s the Sword Banishing from the Gallery of Magick, and it’s, IMHO, the best thing since sliced bread.

You will need a bit of setup first, that amounts to 10-15 minutes of reading and practice.

You can find the book easily by googling ‘Magickal Protection’. It’s by Damon Brand. 

The Kindle version is cheap, but since you may not be inclined to trust a random stranger on the internet, telling you to buy a book you have never heard of, then Zlib is your friend. You will want the epub version that weights 2.68MB.

If you find it useful, buy it. It tends to work a bit better too. I am not affiliated in any way with the author. 

Merry Christmas to all.

The face just looked like a floating blurry white face, no head or body like a floating mask. No features, no eyes, no expression. Always at night. The last time I saw it was around 14 or 15 years old. I'm 32 now but I've been binging paranormal content the last few days and it's been on my mind after seeing similar posts. Something I've noticed is that it doesn't have a ""nickname"" like Hatman(the only shadow person I've seen was hatman) or the Old Hag has. Something different I've noticed about others encounters is they all see it inside the house with them but similarly catch it peeking at them.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I saw it I was around 5 years old. I'm supposed to be going to bed with 2 of my younger sisters. We are in a room on the second floor that has the window uncovered. We are talking and laughing while all the adults are downstairs. We are all laying on our backs on a blanket on the floor facing the only window in the room which was centered on the wall. The face moves in to view from the right side of the window(from our perspective) and begins to just stare down at us. At this point we are all already running out the door crying. I was the last one out and my sisters couldn't run fast enough because I was jumping up and down behind them. My dad did a search around the house and of course found nothing. I've asked one of my sisters about it and she didn't remember. I have to ask my dad if he remembers. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I saw it I was watching my little brother playing video games in the living room one night. This time was in a double wide trailer. The TV was centered between two uncovered windows. I'm sitting behind him watching him play but my mind is somewhere else. I don't know what caused me to look at the window because I don't remember having the feeling of someone watching me and it wasn't movement. I just immediately look at the window and there it(he if it has a gender) is looking right at me. As soon as my eyes made contact with the face it glided quickly to the side out of view. I just sat there struck with intense fear. I didn't say a word about it to my brother.

&amp;#x200B;

Another difference is whenever I saw it it wasn't bending to the side to peek. The face was always in a vertical position, as if it was standing upright if it had a body. Every time I was filled with a crazy strong fear. The first time I saw it was the only time it came in to view and stayed in view staring at us. Every time after that it was already in the window when I caught it watching me and it slipped out of view to the side as soon as my eyes made contact.

I really do believe but I think part of my skepticism is never having a true paranormal experience. Yesterday was the closest.

So as we are leaving my girlfriends moms it’s of course my job to take the gifts to the car. On the small landing between the kitchen door and back door there’s stairs going to an unfinished basement. From the landing the bottom of the stairs is pitch black. While I was on the landing pulling the kitchen door shut getting ready to exit I hear a noise that sounds like someone dragging a heavy cardboard box across concrete. As I turn my head towards the sound what looks to be the outline of something about 3 feet tall dashes quickly across one side to the other, just on the edge of the darkness.

I wasn’t scared or startled. I just kind of thought it was odd. So I stood there and stared down the stairs into the darkness, trying to make out what the noise was and what moved. I can only describe the sound that came next out of the darkness as a visceral growl. Not like an animal growling though. Like a person. It was low and deep and about 1-1/2 seconds long. I’m still not scared. I’m confused. I’m still staring into the darkness wondering what the hell made the noise. A second deep growl comes from the darkness. I got scared. But not just like spooky scared. It was the type of scared that a child becomes scared of the dark basement. A creeping feeling that something was there just beyond the dark staring at me.


I felt just like a kid afraid of the boogie man. I went out the back door and put the presents in the car. I had to go back in to get my girlfriend and the kid. To do that I have to go past the stairs again. I don’t want to. Again just like a child would be scared. As I passed by it again to go inside I went as quick as possible and didn’t look into the basement. I was freaked out but since my girlfriends kid stays the night there and I don’t want to scare her I don’t say anything. I wait until she’s asleep and ask my girlfriend what her mom keeps in the basement. 

She gives the typical joke response of “dead bodies why?” With a half hearted laugh. I ask her to seriously tell me and she can tell something is wrong. There is nothing she keeps in the basement except an old fridge and her washing machine, neither of which I heard running. I’m still thinking about it today.

What is my predicament? Well, I claim that I am haunted, not my house or my property, but me personally.  In the paranormal field, I believe it is called an “attachment” by a malevolent spirit or entity.

At the time of writing this I am 53 years old December 2021. It all started in 2007. In 2007 I was a fairly normal 39 year old male. I worked as a security guard in small hospital located in central  Kentucky.

At this time many paranormal tv shows were becoming very popular. One show “ghost hunters”   In particular I really liked. As I watched each episode from week to week, I became fascinated my the phenomenon called EVP. For anyone who doesn’t know EVP Stands for “electronic voice phenomenon”.  Supposedly disembodied voices are picked up on either digital or tape type voice recorders. The ghosts hunter team had great results doing this , so being the curious George I was, I decided to give it a try. I already had an old digital recorder from my University days so as luck would have it, it wouldn’t cost me anything to try it out.

I recorded first in an old abandoned house next door to me. The first time I tried and played back the recorder I captured my first clear EVP. In response to a question I asked:
“Is anybody here” I got the clear response “I’m right here” in a whispery voice on the recorder after playback. Well I was hooked, I had a mystery on my hands, and since I was by myself I knew it wasn’t a fake or somebody trying to pull one over on me.

I recorded again the next day at the hospital where I worked. In short I was getting many EVP’s, so many in fact I decided to let some of my coworkers listen to them, and to no surprise they heard voices too. After that I admit I became kinda obsessed with the whole phenomenon.” I actually bought some sound editing software for my computer and invested in an external microphone for my recorder. I even uploaded some of my EVP to the ghost hunter website, where many listeners commented that they were some of the best that had ever heard. 

I think it’s important that I tell the reader that I did a very foolish thing at about this time. I wondered if the entity’s or spirits were just like the living and got lonely from time to time, so I audibly while recording invited them to be my friend if they needed one. Looking back I believe that was a big mistake.

Fast forward about a month in time and I decided that I had gone about as far into the phenomenon called EVP as I could and was slightly bored to tell the truth and decided to rest or quit for a while and move on to other endeavors . I put the recorder up, taking out the batteries and shelved it.

This is when things went south very quickly. The next day at work I started having the feeling my name was being whispered in my ear, but it was so low that I just put it off as my imagination. The whispery voices continued, I told no one of course, I just kept it to myself. I mentioned I worked security at a hospital, a few nights after the voices started one of my duties was to relieve the local prison guards guarding hospitalized  inmates while they went to the snack machine and restroom ect, usually takings 20 minutes or so.
No sooner had I relieved the guard and sat down in his chair then did the chair itself begin to vibrate, and  it was no mistaking that it was vibrating, I actually checked another chair close to me in order to make sure it wasn’t everything vibrating, and it wasn’t. The inmate was asleep and the lights were out so I know nothing in the room was causing the vibrations When the guard came back everything stopped and no more vibration.

Well as you can imagine that shook me up quite a bit, I could no longer blame the whispery voices on imagination, I knew “something” was going on.
Bad turned into worse that night after I got home and went to bed, and this I will never forget as long as I live.

After closing my eyes for the night I felt a weird kinda pressure, kinda like sinus pressure but all of a sudden like. Suddenly I heard a woman’s voice in a very commanding tone  right above me say “look we hate you, we hate your mother, we hate your father, we hate your brother and his wife and their bratty little kids and we even hate your mothers yappy little dog” 
That was it, the voice was gone as quickly as it started. Let me explain it was no whispery voice it was loud and authoritative, I was frozen in place while this was going on, head turned to the side of the pillow from fear and bewilderment The puzzling thing is I could feel the displacement of air as she spoke but it wasn’t exactly like breath, it had no smell or anything, it was hard to describe.

That was the start of lots of bizarre and horrific things to come the voices were a constant drone, like a hundred people speaking at once 24/7, I began to even speculate that the 24/7 voices were punishment for trying so hard for the last few months to listen to disembodied voices, but like I said that’s just me speculating. 

I started having nightmares, but not ordinary nightmares, now in my dreams to give a few examples, I was being dragged into a furnace, scratching all the way in. In one nightmare I was in what seemed like a wooden cart with dead bodies, in what looked like a medieval town during maybe the plague times, the nightmare was so vivid I could even smell the rotten flesh of those in the cart with me and the musky smell of the mud in the street.
In yet other nightmares I was driving a car and slammed into a wall with all the pain of the collision till I jarred awake!! These nightmares were nothing like I had had in my previous 39 years on earth.

I wasn’t married, so I had only my parents to confide in. After telling them ,they recommended I go to the hospital and have a MRI and EKG done. I agreed even though I didn’t think that was the problem. When I got the tests back weeks latter they were normal though like I suspected they would be. The paranormal problems persisted and got worse in the following weeks, like invisible hands touching me, and stinging my skin with what felt like Electric shocks, 
One night I had my covers fly off the bed, and as a consequence I haven’t slept in a bed since.
One night while I dozed off on my couch, I was rudely awakened by what felt like a arm grab me under my head and jerk up, as if I wasn’t to go to sleep.

I’m going to shorten the last 13 years up and summarize quite a bit. I started going to a psychiatrist at my parents request and went about 4 years total. I took ever medication that they threw at me, until the side effects from increased dosages became intolerable and always with no benefits to my mental health. All the psychiatrists said it was like nothing they had ever seen and mysterious and just labeled my condition an “undetermined psychosis”

I finally got in touch with 2 sets of paranormal investigators, and the investigations were inconclusive and I received the same advise from both groups, burn sage and spread sea salt. Doing those things didn’t help. 

I have asked myself many times what the entities or whatever they are “want”, and the only answer I can come up with is control. Control of me or my behavior. It seems like anything I enjoy they will force me to stop. How do they force me you ask?
One example, I use to like going to the theater. I went once with a friend and the spirits or entities aggravated me while watching the movie by touching me on the ear, knee, back ect. Trust me you cannot fully enjoy a movie like that. I then decided to be stubborn and  just go see a movie about weeks latter, this time I was frozen out. The bottom half of my body got so cold I couldn’t watch the movie, then halfway through the movie my top half, head shoulders ect got so cold I had to abandon the show 3/4 way through . I just couldn’t enjoy myself anymore. I was also forced to quit smoking, soft drinks other enjoyable things like vacations in the same way. I could keep trying to do things I enjoyed but I was always being aggravated to the point they brought me no pleasure.

I went to the Catholic Church, and told my story, I was told in short that I was probably mentally ill, but the priest did pray with me twice and I did get baptized there. I was not babtized at the time my haunting started and some of the paranormal investigators I mentioned earlier suspected that is why I was open to attachment so easily, and I agree that might have been a factor. 

I guess I need to emphasize that I was more than disappointed when baptism and prayer did not solve my problem. I question myself sometimes, like maybe I was seeking religion just to relieve my suffering and I wasn’t seeking God for the right reasons, I continue to pray that Ill be more sincere in my prayers.

They say that there’s a reason for everything, and my prayers for relief go unanswered, and maybe there’s a reason for that I don’t know.

One prayer was answered once though, it was the worse thing that ever happened to me throughout my ordeal. One night I woke up being attacked sexually. What I can only describe as a unseen male presence was doing unspeakable things to me. And to make thing clear I’m heterosexual, so I was panicking to say the least. But to tell the truth I don’t believe a homosexual man would have liked what was being done, most people gay or straight don’t want to be forced into anything. After it was over I prayed like I had never prayed before , crying to God that it was more than I could bear, and it happened no more, thanks be to God.

Before I started ghost hunting I had heard of evil spirits or ghost attaching themselves to people, but I though that even if that was true, the entities or spirits wouldn’t t mess with me, I was a strong willed person after all, and they would prey on the mentally weak if at all.
Man did I get schooled!

The paranormal investigators I mentioned earlier gave me the advise to stand my ground and fight. Fight by drawing a line in the sand and telling the entities that I wasn’t going to put up with it anymore. I tried that, but it didn’t work out for me ,it just seemed to agg them on, and it got worse, so that is where I am at now. I’m just at wits end. 

So my advise to anyone looking for paranormal adventures for the mystery and thrills of it….I get you, I was there once, but take my advise and don’t do it or at the very least don’t do it alone.
Another point the paranormal research group members  made to me was that : I was probably an easier target because I was alone. They also said that they conclude every investigation with a closing prayer for all members and I did none of that.

Trust me from experience, if you ever end up with an entity attachment, you will have a hard time convincing others of your haunted situation, it’s just hard to wrap the head around a subject so terrifying, taboo, and yes, even uncomfortable.
You will feel more alone than you ever conceived possible, even in the presence of others. I eventually confided in a close friend and while he didn’t just tell me to get lost, he started making excuses in order to not be around me and now it’s been 8 years since we spoke. It’s just easier to write you off as mentally Ill or disturbed. I guess if loved ones thought you were really haunted and they could do nothing about it, it would be either scary to them or agonizing or both. I understand that. 

To be honest I can’t prove any of this is happening to me, so I don’t try to prove anymore. The famous scientist Carl Sagan once said “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence” and I admit I don’t have that evidence as proof of my claims. You might conclude that I must be as “crazy as a soup sandwich” But in the remote chance that I might be telling the truth please be careful out there! 

If I can save one person from going through what I have went through the last 14 years it will have been worth it. However, If you do find yourself in my situation even after this warning, I don’t really know what to tell you as far as advise goes ,as I’m still stuck in it myself. Please don’t give up though, your not alone. 

Thank You

So many years have passed but I still feel it. Every night, lights on or off, I feel like I am being watched. That same feeling haunts me almost every night.

There is an explaination for this yes, but I think something is happening in this flat. Together with this feeling I see this figure in the shadows and in mirrors. Sometimes when I look in mirrors I dont move how I am supposed too aswell. 

I am so sure it is not just my mind because I saw it interacting with things, never just phasing out of existance (just disappearing behind something) and I heared it producing sounds. 

I am the last person to believe in the paranormal but I think I am being haunted. Why is it after me and why hasnt it taken action? Is it taunting me-playing with me?

I also found this triangle thing? 

I guess I should give some back story. My name is Melanie. I moved into my house about 7 months ago, and it was a disaster. I'm not the richest person, so there was a deal struck and I cleaned the house out from the previous tenants.

I hadn't seen the place before I moved in. It was a desperate situation I would rather not dive into. When I moved in there was expired canned food and expired candy waist high from the living room to the kitchen. Shit and used condoms on the floor. It was bad. Coal stove. (I'm a single mom, I had no clue what I was doing lol) Very old, rigged together house.

So the first thing I noticed was that in the basement there is a tunnel DUG OUT that has a small turn (it's not very long) that leads to a small...circular tiny room? Only way I can explain it. Maybe a small child could stand up in it, but I'm 5'2"" and couldn't. All that is there is a light hanging from the middle of the ceiling. This is all just rock and cement. The only way I can explain the light is...in the brave little toaster (lol) when they go to the store with the other appliances and that big lamp that sings? Lemme Google quick...pendant light? I can't decide if that's cool or dumb. I digress 🤷🏻‍♀️

Okay so than I get this weird video footage cut through my recording. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/T2ay9sz

I was using Facebook messenger, I was sending a video of me playing my game on my laptop to my friend, it was only on my phone, it took up all screen, even my time and notifications. I checked all Facebook stories and open tabs and nothing. I have no idea where this is and I have never seen it before. It didn't appear on the computer, only on my phone.

Okay here's what you've all been waiting for. Me and my 15-year-old son were setting up the attic for his room. He recently decided to move up to the Attic. It was always used for storage. There's a tiny cubby hole that we were clearing out. To the far left wall the small end of the wall was carpeted. Thinking that was really strange I ripped the carpet down and found boards and there was a crack in between two of them so I used the flashlight and looked inside and there was a whole other room. Bigger than the cubby hole that we were already in.

Of course me and him kicked the boards down like beasts 🤷🏻‍♀️ all that was in there was wooden shutters wooden boards pipes and debris and a lot of insulation. I saw a piece of wood that looked strangely smooth and out of place so I flipped it over and it was a Ouija board. I've done some research since and it is a 1939 William Fuld Mystifying Oracle Board. I did not find the planchette with it but I found that weird triangle thing. My 15-year-old son said fuck this I'm out and left me there to be possessed.

Since then I have put the Ouija board on the mirror of my dresser as a decoration. Everybody keeps telling me to get rid of it and burn it. I don't want to. I don't feel anything evil from it...I kind of really feel a connection with it. I'm not trying to be all Reagan Captain Howdy here, but it's the truth. 

I also forgot to mention the weird things that have been happening. Normal things like toys going off or things going missing and reappearing. Recently me and my friend who is frequently here have been seeing things. People. I saw a man, twice. I can chalk the first one up to my mind playing tricks on me, it was a split second he was there, I looked at my phone and he was gone. 

But a week later, I was driving down a dark back road that is really windy. I live out in the boonies where there's nothing but woods everywhere. I was driving and of course paying attention because I had my son in the car (not that I don't pay attention when it's just me lol) and there was nothing there. But when I looked in the rearview mirror, and I looked three separate times within the span of a few seconds, not 10 ft away was a man slowly walking away from the car in the middle of the side of the street I was driving on. He came out of absolutely nowhere and there's no way he could have been there that fast. Not as close to the car as he was. He had a fedora/bowler hat looking thing on and what looks like a suit jacket and he was walking very slow. I saw him three separate times when I looked in the rearview mirror and then he was gone. My 12 year old son says he did not see him. He didn't see the other man either 🤷🏻‍♀️

So I guess I really don't know what to do with all of this information and I am really new to Reddit. I posted in a couple of other places and I'm really not sure if I'm even allowed to post links here but it wouldn't let me post anything other than text. I recently learned how to use imgur which I actually completely hate. But I heard this is the place to come if you have a mystery that needs to be solved.

So please help me! I guess what I really want is information, especially on the video footage and what could possibly be going on in this house or what could have been going on.

A little back story: Every Sunday since I can remember, I go to my grandparents house to have a lunch. Usually my aunt took me, but I got my licence 3 weeks ago, so I've been driving myself there. I've been using my grandpa old car. Their house it's 30 minutes away (more or less) from where I live. They live in a kinda of isolated place, so the drive there is very specific. Never lots of cars, usually just people who live there.

Today I was driving there,  it was raining and since it's the day after Christmas there were barely any cars on the road. Then, I saw this car on the other side. Didn't think any of it but because I was driving alone I took a look to make sure everything was alright (just got my licence so I'm being extra careful with everything). 

Well, first thing I saw was that the car was exactly the same as mine. Which is fine, because it's a normal car to see around. Not like it's super unusual.

But then I looked at the driver, and I SWEAR IT WAS ME. It was like looking at my own reflection. I immediately got chills and had to stop the car down the road because I couldn't believe what I had just saw. I was stunned, in shock. 

I can almost swear that I saw myself driving. It was such a weird feeling, I don't know how to explain it.

I guess it could've been a doppelgänger, but the whole feeling I had from the encounter was just weird.

Idk, is there a logical explanation to this?

Hello! So honestly I’m not sure if I should consider this a paranormal or UFO encounter, but I’m honestly not sure if what I saw would be considered an UFO.

This happened in winter of 2016, when I was home for winter break from college. Late one night my friend and I were walking in my parents’ nice neighborhood near downtown looking for a place to smoke. For some reason, my friend and I stupidly decided that we’d go to the nearby elementary playground. (They had swings)

When we turned the corner of the elementary school on the sidewalk, I saw in a short distance of maybe 50-75 feet a void black oval hovering blob/mass about two feet tall quickly moving a few inches above the ground across the street from us. As it hovered towards the curb of the sidewalk in front of us, it smoothly floated over the curb so it DEFINITELY didn’t have legs.

When it moved under the streetlight, it didn’t give off a reflection so whatever it was didn’t seem to be man made either. 

After it floated over the curb and sidewalk, it stopped at one of the elementary building that had a gap under it, (the school is on a hill) then it like… squished/warped to a black flat oval shape and slipped under the gap. 

My friend and I quickly glanced at each other to make sure that we both had seen what we saw, and then we ran over to the gap under the building and I flashed my phone’s light there but couldn’t see anything.

After I got home, I scoured the internet for any info I could find but there wasn’t anything.

You may see the post if you go to my profile. I tried to post a follow up maybe two months ago but Reddit removed it saying duplicate post so I don’t want to type all this out again and it get removed. Anyway. Since the last post about my husbands foot issue flaring up and not getting better, we’d been to sooo many doctors and finally one did surgery end of august. He is STILL not fully “healed” and it’s just such a long and arduous story….the moral is nothing has gotten better here…it’s worse. I feel there has to be a demon or evil spirit just taking over this home and it’s hurting everything. I am so scared for my daughter who is 6 months old now. 

My almost 14 year old dog, my best friend in the world, passed away in October. She had some health issues throughout her life but always very well managed. Had arthritis and a small hurt murmur which was controlled by meds and she was totally totally fine. Yes she was old and yes I know she would eventually decline….but within the matter of one week, she was throwing up and eventually stopped eating altogether which is the least unlike her. We took her to the vet and she was admitted to the hospital for high kidney values. She never got better, kidney values skyrocketed and she was there for 4 days before we ultimately took her home for 8 hours to spend our last moment together before letting her forever sleep. I was gutwrenched. She never had any kidney issues and it came out of nowhere. It was SO fast. 

Now, my cat who is 10 is going through the exact same thing. But this time liver values. Vomiting, stopped eating, and it’s looking like a bad path. This cat has been healthy and fine her entire life and this is not normal. She’s only 10 and has NEVER had issues before. I am so distraught and convinced this house has evil in it that is trying to hurt my animals to hurt us and feed off our suffering. Will my daughter be next???

The orbs in her room that I see on her monitor are CONSTANT. I don’t know if it’s family member protecting her or what. She stirs a lot when they fly over her. I’m at a loss and I need to leave this house. Will it help? Is this spirit attached to the home or us?

I sat up to look and there was nothing there. All three of my cats were sound asleep. I checked my carbon monoxide alarm and there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with it. I was completely sober, other than having two drinks at Christmas Eve dinner the night before.

It’s simple,  extremely effective, doesn’t require anything, can be used at any time and in any place, and performed in just a few seconds once it has been memorized. 

It’s the Sword Banishing from the Gallery of Magick, and it’s imho the best thing since sliced bread. 

You will need a bit of setup first, that amounts to 10-15 minutes of reading and practice.

i grew up in a house that im 100% sure was haunted.
My first experience was when i was about 9/10 years old,the house had 2 floors and a bathroom on each of them. The bathroom on the 1st floor was occupied so i went to the bathroom upstairs,there was a long haul to the bathroom and a pretty long staircase so after i was done i started walking back through the haul.I noticed something was off about my shadow so i looked at it and my shadow started running when i was just standing still i got really creeped out so i started running to the stairs,but not for long because i stopped on the beggining of the staircase and i was not able to move at all i remember just staring on the clock and then i started to scream very loudly and i could not control it at all,it was like i was freezed in time. After i was able to move again i stopped screaming and run down the stairs,very terrifed. My parents took me to the psychologist who told me i should stop watching action movies,and i was conviced it didnt happen because of too much movies.After some months same scenario,the 1st bathroom was occupied so i had to go to the 2nd floor bathroom,i was really scared but i went anyway.After using the bathroom i started walking down the haul and i thought to myself ""you won't catch me now"" started walking down the staircase and same thing happened i was not able to move and started screaming which i could not control. This time my parents just brushed it off and we didnt talk about it. Since then i didnt go to the 2nd floor in years.Fast forward some years later i was 14/15 years old. After we moved out of there my parents told me their paranormal stories from that house like the tv turning on and off by itself or the scariest one, my mum saw me walking to the bathroom at night and she didnt see me walking back so she went to check on me but i wasnt in the bathroom,i was sleeping in my room. Me and my brother went to visit my grandparents and i was older then so i brushed off my previous experiences from that house and decided to sleep in one of the bedrooms upstairs,everything was fine till i had to go to that bathroom to brush my teeth.I was done brushing my teeth and i decided to look in the mirror. In the mirror i could see a part of the haul. I looked at the mirror and in the haul there was a person just standing there and immediately looked behind me but there was nothing there. I was really terrified i went downstairs and got a bible to read even though i was not religious at all.After that 6 years later i still havent put my foot even close to the staircase or the second floor. Its also worth adding that my grandparents havent had any paranormal encounter there and they slept in a bedroom upstairs.Also when i still lived there we had a visit from my very far uncle who said that there was a ghost in that house,he also had a ghost in his house but he said it was a ghost of his father.He never did anything bad,you could just see him from time to time.Now im 20 years old and even though im not a religious person i fully believe in ghosts and good/bad energy.

I know this may sound ego as fuck but I swear it's not. These past couple of months I have been taking 2cb to trip and figure myself out. The lower doses were pure fun (15-20mg). I felt the literal NEED to do doses of upwards of 45-50mg and my friend was very persistent on not letting that happen but I kept insisting. From what I know now a shadow demon attacked me when i was younger, punching the too of my bunk bed and animating my teddy bear. It leeched onto me and is planting evil thoughts, making me become dissociated to the point where music in my literal headphones become waves. And when I was using the small doses the entity did not enjoy that so it planted in my head to use doses a lot higher. That made me turn so dissociated for months and I did MANY unspeakable EVIL things that I honestly dont know how some of those people still talk to me. Anyways the other night I ""tripped"" (when I purely submit myself and relax i can kinda trip) and my shoulder was dislocated in july, so when I completely relaxed i was in the position of baphomet and was honestly not frightened at first but looking back now and realizing i might be possessed by him is something. After researching on this app for clues to help I stumbled upon shadow demons and people deal with them the same as I did. There are things in the bhuddist bible (sorry im new and just looked this stuff up) that indicate you can get the entity out with a ceremony.
I was in my own head able to get him out because i felt ""clear"" but the second that happened every hair on my body rose and moved indifferently. And when i tried to fall asleep to make it permanent it literally felt as if my muscles were twitching but it didnt hurt and it was not pleasant. I eventually came actoss where someones kid slept with their parent and that helped but it made the situation 10x worse.

It's a house that's about 50 or so years old and I rebuild some parts to make it more modern, the previous owners are still alive so never went with the process of asking to the dead. It's a one floor house so you can hear pretty much everything from any pont of the house, as long as it's mildly loud.

 There's one catch though, it's in the outskirts and the local graveyard it's like 300~ meters in a straight line from this house, with full view of it all the time but we are not bother by it.

Few months back I started seeing shadows on corners, nothing to worrisome since I always have seen those so just put it aside. After this my mom and I started hearing sounds from the ""attic"" ( it's just a small space where all the cables, water heater, and AC main installations are) but we put blame it on some rate or bats since it wouldn't be the first time we found one there. 

Then it started to go a little more, I was on my PC with my dog sleeping on my bed and my mom watching tv on the living room. Suddenly I hear a couple of knocks on the front door and so does my dog cause she starts to bark and we both head out, note that she is a german shepherd so it's quite loud. We both head out just to find my mom casually on the couch surprised since she didn't hear anything. That scared me a bit since I was playing with headphones and heard it clear as day, plus I couldn't be imagining things since my dog heard it as well.

For the next three ones ( separate days) I was alone at home, two of them my dog was inside. The first one she was sleeping in my bed again when I heard some of screech coming from inside the house, I panicked, quickly got up and run to the living room with all lights on and the fireplace. The second one my dog was on the living room on her own bed when I heard it again but this time instead of being more primitive it kind of seem that it tried to say my name which made me freak out totally to the point were I started talking back out loud saying stuff like ""come face to face I know you are here"" but with no response.  The last time it was just again the more primitive one but I didn't react. Neither of the three times my dog heard anything, or at least she didn't react. 

The last one it was this last week, similar scenario as the first knock, but I was on the couch, my mom on her PC working and my dog outside. We both heard a loud and what seemed malicious bang on the door. Picture yourself as if someone angrily banging on your door, but it was just one time. Mom comes out of the room and stares at me and I proceed to go out to check, but as you can expect, nothing, and my dog sleeping at her house.

We didn't consider doing any cleaning nor calling priest since nothing bad has happened. We both believe that there is something else, but we are not Catholics. I don't know if it may be one or some spirits that came to visit us, since again, we live pretty close to the graveyard and before us the house was inhabit for some years. What worries me is the fact that it may have followed me from the last home and it's attached to me since it said my name once and to my knowledge nothing happened there when I'm not home.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937871,public,new,self,Either I'm being haunted or it's proximity.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/roy6ar/either_im_being_haunted_or_its_proximity/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As if after hearing it, the rooster would crow, like how a dog barks at a sound. But it was a sound I’d never heard before. Definitely not from a car or other person’s house. I tried recording the noise but it was too faint for my phone to record. The reason I’m posting it here is because I remember thinking ‘what if it’s alien?’.

My mom once told me that in the night my grandpa passed all clocks in the house stopped exactly at the time of his death. Also sometimes the clock in the kitchen started spinning really fast without any reason.

Well back to the story, I layed in my bed and looked at the window. Suddenly I saw a green hand waving at me from the outside. The weird thing is that the window is really high above the ground and theres no possibility that someone could have waved from the outside. I also asked my mom if someone was outside that night, but there was nobody.

I don’t know if my story is super paranormal, but here we go.

First, some quick background on me. I’m not a skeptic or a true believer in the paranormal, but the idea of ghosts brings a small level of comfort. The one thing I definitely believe in is premonitions, I’ve had a few and they worked out.

My great-grandmother died a few years ago at the age of 101. She was in such a state that her death didn’t surprise anyone, and we kind of knew it was coming.

One other thing to know about me: I find personifications of death fascinating. Don’t believe one actually exists, but seeing them in fiction is really cool.

Three days before my great-grandmother died, I had a very vivid dream. I was in her apartment (she lived in a very fancy retirement complex) with the Grim Reaper. It was just the two of us, everything was an airy light blue, and the general understanding was that my great-grandmother just passed. I had the exact same dream two days before her death, but not on the day before. Then my grandfather called my mom to break the news.

My mom and I share similar beliefs: she thinks ghosts sound cool but doesn’t hold a strong opinion.

If you have experienced sleep paralysis, then you probably have some idea what I'm talking about. I do believe that even though SP might have a scientific explanation behind why it happens, I believe that SP has a connection with the Spirit World in some way or another. But nonetheless, you will find this story interesting.

This happened to me roughly 3 years ago. I am in the military and at the time, I lived in Unaccompanied Personnel Housing on base with a roommate. 

My room was kind of like a dorm room with rough blue carpeting where we had to use room keys to access our room. The room had two twin-sized beds; one of them was to the left as soon as you walk in with its respectable dresser and table. Our beds where seperated by two movable closets for privacy and my bed was at the far side of the room near the window. Across from my bed was my dresser up against the wall with the door leading to the bathroom next to it. We also had a fridge to the right as you walk in with a microwave on top of it.

Now that we have a mental picture of what the room looks like, we can continue on to the good part of the story. I was all alone in my room one night lying in my bed. I fall asleep only to open my eyes and find myself on my back, unable to move. It was dark and there was a bit of ambient light peaking in through the window blinds coming from the streetlight outside the lobby. Everything seemed hazy and fuzzy. I immediately knee what was happening and remained calm. ""Sleep Paraylsis..."" I thought to myself. All the sudden, I see a very dark, murky shadown figure leaning over top my dresser about 9 ft in front of me. I sensed that it didn't have a malevolant energy attached to it, nor a benevolant energy.

It was just observing me, probably watching me while I was sleeping. It felt like I was peering into another dimension only to see this thing. I had some crystals set up around my bed for protection so that's why I assumed it didn't get any closer to me. Anyway, after I see this shadow figure, I begin to feel my heart racing and I began to breathe heavily. After about 5 seconds or so, it slowly stands up, seemingly growing in height. It's head was almost touching the ceiling at this point. Then, it begins to slowly walk towards my fridge my door. The weirdest thing happened; once it reached the fridge, it walked into the fridge as if it were a some kind of portal that it had originally came from. It bent down to walk INTO the door of the fridge with one leg hanging out and just froze there for another second. Then, I woke up only to stare at the same spot where I saw the shadow figure and nothing was there.

Many other weird things prior to this occurence would happen within the room, like coming back from work to find my roommate's tv on, feeling drained, even sensing a presence in the corner by my fridge all of the time, and hearing whispering in my ear as I layed on my bed. This encounter I had while experiencing sleep paraylsis solidified this notion.

This past month I've let my nephew use a stuffed animal that I've had since I was 2 gotten for me from a Goodwill. I have 16 years of personal experience believing in that this stuffed bunny is at least ingrained with nightmares. I've had vivid nightmares with this bunny and I still remember them all. And when you stop sleeping with it it gets worse but fades. I would describe the dreams but their not the focus here. I also have many accounts of Angel (the bunny's name since I was 3) disappearing and having other minor occurrences of being around places like the backspace workshop in the garage or other things. Now it just tends to be of minor to average affect on me.

I have only one dream that I think also settles the matter of it being Angel and not just my child hood. To preface this I had been using these stuffed animals besides Angel due to its absence. I added it the the others and when I started dreaming they were all standing at the railway wish me bye as I said I was leaving for work (meaning school) when it turned dark as soon as Angel spoke in a sharp female voice ""You mean school?"". After that the all had terribly wicked smiles and laughed as they chased me off. This is prefaced that I had been using the rest of the stuffed animals for days before some of them even being of similar timed owned. She controlled all the characters instead of me in my own dream.

His son is 3 and I decided to let him use her since I hadn't really thought about the situations and problems that I've had with her, but recently he's been having nightmares and Angel is no where in sight. It's not just a simple search the house because it's kept organized and she doesn't leave my bedroom unless she does it or she's getting washed. My cat also doesn't sleep with me if the stuffed bunny is on the bed.

Let me start this by saying yes, I believe in the paranormal. I believe in evil and good spiritual entities along with feeling that at least some UFO activity is indeed not from this world. 

With that said, I am also a huge skeptic. 

So, my wife wanted to watch *The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch* Documentary on Hulu. I've known about the Ranch and the old stories for years. So I was interested in what the Documentary had to say.

However, as we watched I kept feeling like the whole thing was being staged. ""No digging! It's bad!"" And ""we hid evidence from you before bringing you on the property!"" DUN, DUN, DUUUUUUN! 

It just feels like a interesting thriller story, and not a real investigation. And an easy way to make money off of those interested in the paranormal. 

After the first episode I kinda just want to move on. So I wanted to ask a community of paranormal minded individuals.

Do you belive the stories of the Ranch?

Is the Documentary real in your opinion? 

Is the Documentary worth the investment of time to see what other evidence they offer?

My name is Jake. No, I'm not an Animorph.

This events happened to me when I was younger. I'm now 36 years of age. At the time of these events I was around the ages of 4 or 5. I was living with my parents in Rockford, Illinois. We owned a two story house when I was younger. Big basement, bar and big screen TV, a pool outside, and all the toys I could imagine. Many of the kids within our neighborhood would often try to come over to play in our yard and wanted to swim in our pool. They never wanted to hang out with me, but always wanted to use my things... but I digress. 

My father ran a carpet cleaning business and was on the road a lot. He would travel in a van and hang around some less than savory characters. Most often employees or people that he worked for that would steal from him.. My mother worked in a radiology lab. Both were consistently employed, however, my dad's story was a little darker than usual. Because of the overall nature of his job, his background, and how he grew up, he was heavily into drugs. Looking back now, I don't really blame him and forgive him for what transpired. At this age however, I was constantly afraid of him. He had a violent and explosive temper combined with the things he suffered as a child. He was borderline abusive. My mother and him would often get into screaming matches. At a young age I learned to be fairly quiet as to not upset anyone. I still maintain a silent demeanor to this very day because of their fights.

Anyway, my dad had a major cocaine problem at this point in my life. Often he would sleep in the downstairs basement and be up all night watching TV. He was constantly depressed and hated his job. As an uber driver in the modern day times... I can't blame him. Being on the road is rather cruel and you can run into all sorts of crazy characters.

That being said, I've had my fair share of paranormal encounters from that age. 

One time I dreamed I was walking around my house and my father appeared to me from the hallway. His head was attached to the body of a snake. When I asked him what he was doing...he said ""Hey Jake, what are you doing out of bed?"". At this moment he ""stood up"" within the dream and was wrapped in bedsheet in his underwear. I woke up around this time, not knowing what to make of it. 

If I ran too fast upstairs while playing he would often wake up and yell at me to quit jumping. Sometimes his yelling genuinely frightened me. Like he was extra angry and wrathful over small things because of his life and circumstances.

One day I was walking past the stairs to the basement where he usually slept. I turned my head and I saw this tall monster come running up the stairs. The best way I can describe this creature was that it had the body of the HR Giger design from the movie Alien or Aliens. Look it up if you're unfamiliar with it. The only difference with this thing was that it had an upside down star head on top of it instead of the elongated head the creatures are known to have within the movies. It ran from the bottom of the stairs, curved around at the landing where the stairs spun upwards and sort of ran or shambled up towards me. However, when it came to the threshold of the very top stair it suddenly stopped. It vanished the very moment it tried getting to me. Needless to say I never went into the basement for the longest time. I was sort of afraid of it at night and even though I had a TON of toys most kids usually played with... I stayed away from it after that encounter. It was sort of like I was seeing it within the mind but knew it was spiritually there at the exact same time. Not physically present, but a weird in between.

My dad continued to suffer and my parents eventually divorced a few years down the line. With that being said... I'll never forget that one vision and seeing that damned thing.

To most it may be the celebrated birth of the world's savior, to the children an excuse to beg for that one expensive toy every kid in America has to have next year, but to me, this was my fiancee's (Let's call her R) first year together, but mostly my dad's birthday. Born Christmas of 1955 and passing August 21st 2012, he would have been 66 had he still been here, but I guess life is a flowerbed, and the almighty one always picks the prettiest flowers first.

For the past 3 years since I've really picked up an interest in the paranormal, I've made many attempts to make contact with him. Most at night, others during the day, but all attempts seemed futile. It didn't matter, witching hour seemed to do nothing in my attempts besides bring forth negative spirits and groups often felt threatening presences opposed to the kinder ones of other family buried in the graveyard. 3 years of hopelessly searching for my dad's spirit on top of another 6, 9 years total just missing the man, I thought his spirit was lost to time with the exception of mine and other family's memories, until tonight. 

After an action packed day of Christmas celebration between my family and that of my fiancee, the night finally wound down. R's exhausted, I'm not too far off, but I had one order of business left to attend: I still want to share a drink with Dad for his birthday. The plan was to get a couple shooter bottles of Jack Daniel's since that was his Whiskey of choice according to my brothers, spend a few minutes at his grave and mourn as I saw fit. Since I had R with, I figured I may as well introduce the two of them, no better time than the present. 

To my surprise, before leaving my brothers gift me a 12 pack of Budweiser, it was probably bought cold but ot wasn't by the time it reached my hands. Oh well, lukewarm beer is better than a hot one I suppose, plus Dad liked Budweiser too from what I understood, so hopefully he won't complain too much. We take all backroads to the graveyard, its about 8:30 and the headlights from my Ranger soon become nothing more than lanterns in an abyss of darkness as rural homes and light posts become empty fields and moonlight. 15 minutes later and my old short bed Ford rattles up the cemetery drive, parking in front of the threshold. 

I know it's dark, but once I kill the lights and the engine, it's pitch in the cab and a little chilly on the air. I saw fog on the roads leading to the cemetery, there's gotta be something active, I can feel it. Before crossing I announce myself, these spirits are familiar with me, the active ones I know are since this also served as the location for my first confirmed paranormal experiences as an adult. I say my name, explain who R is, ending with ""I mean no harm, she's with me, I'm just here to have a beer with my Dad."" And cross the threshold. I navigate past the head stones, careful not to step on anyone purposely. We reach Dad's grave and I verbally introduce Dad to R, talking briefly about him, before cracking open a beer, holding it to his direction and saying ""Happy Birthday Dad, this one's for you."" Drinking half the beer and pouring the other half for him. Not long after I'm in R's arms grieving for about 5 minutes while I lose myself in memories. I notice she's fidgeted a bit more than usual, so after the song ends, I say my goodbyes and head to the truck with her in tow before either my paranoia or the wrong spirit kills me, either way, I had my gut feeling to wrap things up.

As we drive home, R tells me she had noticed a few interactions, asking if insects were active. Its December in the Midwest, it feels like October but it isn't operating as such. Obviously I say ""No."" To which she explained felt like a grazing pinch almost. I almost chalk it up to one of the more mischievous spirits until she asks where Dad used to pinch at when joking around. I tell her ""Usually around the wrist or forearm."" Her response? ""You're joking with me!"" I'm shocked, and start thinking of other explanations and other hints she got. The one that definitely confirmed my thoughts, or so I believe was while I was mourning, I had my head on her shoulder, she was standing diagonal to Dad's grave with her left side to him. She felt something almost comfort her, like a parental force. She also noticed her hair messed with, a small tug to let her know something was there before trying to push it behind her ear. When I heard this I began crying again. I recognized that from my childhood, even the pinch she mentioned. This was all stuff Dad did to me as a kid, so to know he's still doing that reassured me he's alright in a sense and he's heard me every time I went to him for advice. It's a closure I've looked for for quite some time, just never thought I'd feel it.

About 9 years ago I lived in an apartment in a tourist town in Colorado. Kind of an old miner's town that is popular both with the locals of the nearby city and tourists. It sits in a nice valley at the base of a popular mountain with a lovely little downtown and is just an overall delightful place to live. 

The apartment was the main floor of an old building with about four units in the main building. According to google it was built in 1909. It wasn't in the best shape and wasn't one of the pretty Victorian buildings also around but it was an affordable way to live in a lovely town. The unit itself was pretty odd, I think moreso than the other ones in the building. It had an ancient brick fireplace that didn't work because the chimney was removed to build above it and had wood paneling on the walls. 

The weirdest part for sure was that in the kitchen in between the fridge and the shelving was a door in the wood paneling. It was just a cutout in the paneling itself so it wasn't apparent unless you were looking for it because it had no knob and instead had only a latch for a padlock. You had to step up to go inside and then inside was a dirt floor and unfinished brick walls and just wood beams on the ceiling. It sloped gradually upwards towards the back so if you wanted to get to the very back you'd have to crawl on your stomach in the dirt. (Yeah I never did that.) There was a bare lightbulb on the ceiling with a switch but the back stayed dark. By the way this room was in the middle of the whole house. It seemed like a cellar or basement or something but it sloped upwards towards the middle of the house. Just weird. We used it for storage but for the most part avoided it because it was so odd. We found a few animal bones and straps hanging from the pipes inside like something had been tied up. Also found a few newspapers from the 60s and even a few old kids' drawings.

Let me say first of all that I'm typically a skeptic until given proof that can't be explained any other way. I've been fascinated by the paranormal most of my life but nearly all ""evidence"" I've ever seen for most paranormal things seems easily dismissable with other explanations. My mom and I used to stay overnight at an authentic haunted house every Halloween for years when I was a kid and I never saw anything compelling no matter how much I wanted to.

So the apartment was technically two bedroom but both bedrooms were tiny tiny and you had to go through one to get to the other. So my roommate ended up preferring to sleep on the couch. This didn't bother me and worked out fine for us because we were really close. I can't remember the exact order of things that happened but most of it focused on her.

She woke up with three scratches on her back a couple of times. Often she would get them on her arms when she would reach down to get something off the floor in front of the couch. Once it happened to me. I was sitting on the couch and went to move to sit in the chair across from it while I talked to my roommate. It was summer so I was in shorts. I sit with my legs up on the seat usually so I moved and pulled my legs up when I felt burning on the back of my calf. I had three scratches on my calf that were bleeding slightly. I had only moved a couple feet and didn't feel anything before that. The scratches were fresh. This only ever happened near the couch.

There was activity in the kitchen where the strange room was. My roommate would regularly hear footsteps in the kitchen when she was falling asleep. I brushed it off as just her dreaming or hearing the neighbors or the house creaking. But I heard it once when we were up late talking. I asked ""What the hell is that?"" Genuinely afraid. She said it was what she was talking about and that she heard it most nights. It was definitely in the kitchen and was unmistakable footsteps. I never heard it any other time.

My roommate also couldn't use the kitchen light. This is a weird one. She offhandedly mentioned that the ceiling light in the kitchen didn't work. I was confused and asked if the bulb went out and she said ""No it's never worked."" Like it was obvious. I got up to show her and turned it on. It went on fine. A little later we were talking about it and she went to flip it on and it didn't work. I got up to see and, no joke, when she turned around to face me, it turned on. I told her and it went off again as she turned back towards it. Problems with other electronics also happened pretty often.

My roommate has been vegan pretty much her whole life because she doesn't really like meat. She would even take the hot dogs out of pigs in a blanket when she was a kid. One week she started craving red meat. We were buying package after package of roast beef deli meat that she ate straight out of the bag. This one could potentially have been a hormone thing or something but it was definitely weird. Never happened again.

We both struggle with anxiety and depression but hers got significantly more severe as well. She slept a lot and had trouble working. This wasn't exactly a new problem for her but it definitely got worse.

I do tarot readings for myself for clarity (yes I'm a skeptic by default but I've been doing tarot since I was a kid and it always worked for me so I use it even if I don't know why it works) and one time I did a reading for another friend that was visiting. As I was laying out the cards I suddenly got really emotional and upset. Looking at the cards with how I was feeling I just remember thinking ""this isn't a reading for my friend anymore."" Without looking at the cards any further, I immediately stopped and put the cards away. I felt like something had invaded my body and tried to use my cards to communicate. It was a horrible feeling that has never happened in the decades I've been doing tarot again.

Things got worse when we were working on moving out. I mean it just seemed like we kept hitting road blocks. We couldn't seem to get everything done in time and we were rushing like crazy. My mom was helping us, she's an alcoholic. But her drinking became constant and fighting with her became out of control. We couldn't get a handle on anything. 

About a week before we had to be out, my landlady called me. This was the worst thing that happened and the thing that sounds most like a cliche horror movie. The voice on the other end was male and very deep. It was talking very angrily in another language but not one I could recognize. Like not even Latin or anything like in movies, totally bizarre sounding. As it went on, it got faster and angrier. At this point I was scared and my roommate was looking at me and I could tell she knew what was happening because she looked horrified just from looking at my face. I think I was covering my mouth from fear. At the end it just turned into a loud growl that got louder and louder before it cut off. I think I started crying. My landlady called back and apologized and said she was driving through a tunnel.

After I left I had a few people tell me that they heard that town used to have a history of occult and satanic behavior. Which honestly wouldn't surprise me because it's a bit of a hippie town and there's a thin line between your average hippie occult crystals and tarot stuff and fucking with shit you shouldn't be.

Basically I think whatever we were dealing with was not something that had died or just leftover energy of some kind. I think it was something that had been invited in to the house sometime in the past. It seemed to be consciously reacting to us and targeting my roommate intelligently. I found out afterwards that the three scratches are supposedly a demon thing. I'm not Christian so I still scoff at the ""mocking the holy Trinity"" idea of it but this definitely didn't feel like something that was natural to this realm. I've also heard that they can utilize energy from electricity to drain people and such. It felt like something that both functioned on instinct but also was more intelligent and powerful than us by far. It did feel like being laughed at by something that looked down on us.

The whole experience changed my thoughts on a lot of things and made me a little less quick to assume something to be complete bullshit just because there's no compelling physical evidence. I have no evidence either and I don't think I could've gotten it if I tried because, as I said, this thing was smarter than us and probably wants people to underestimate it.

But uh I know I experienced something! (maybe) 

So basically when it started I was like in 4th grade, I was really into things like ghosts and demons and '*tried'* to summon demons and spooky shit like that because WOAH FUN!

So one night I was sleeping, It was raining pretty heavily before I went to bed but I woke up and I was basically sweating a lot and it felt like the entire room was moving while there were just constant clashes of thunder. I mean it sounds pretty normal except the fact that I felt like I was being watched constantly while sitting up in my basically experiencing all of this. It wasn't until it stopped that I started to hear music come from my bathroom (which is connected to my room). It was like music box ice cream truck music and it scared the hell out of me. I tried to go to sleep afterwards and it stopped so I thought that was the end of it. 

So fast forward a few months and after I get done watching a movie with my parents I see this little girl kinda looks like the girl from the ring, standing outside the study room window (in our house we have a study room) and she's just still. I went in and I flicked on the light and she was just gone from the window. At first, I kinda thought I was an object in the study room reflecting off the window so I saw her again when I flicked off the light and started to wave my hand in her direction behind me but there was nothing indicating reflection into the window. So i just slowly walked out and hid in my room. Weeks after that happened she was gone from the window but I constantly saw shadows on the wall looking like her. 

A few years later nothing really happens, but I notice that a room upstairs in the house is always unusually cold. I just chalk it up to maybe Air conditioning but even when the high conditioning was hotter in the winter months it was always stupidly cold in that one room. I also have dogs and they just refuse to really even go in that room sometimes, especially at night. 

So yeah the room is cold as hell but nothing freaky so I'm all like ""yeah that's Jeffery"" kinda giving a name to the strange happenings. 

So nothing really happens 

until like 6th grade. So I was talking to my friends one night and I was kinda just telling them about all the strange stuff that happened. It's like 12am so no one in my house is like up. The really cold room door is open, and my room door is open. 

 So I kinda gaze at the door to the room and kinda just like ""oh there's nothing there, but then again I do feel like I'm being watched. So i shut my room door. Next thing I know I start hearing thumps and footsteps that are really just kind of heavy on my carpet upstairs. And I start to get a little nervous so I open my room door and I just gaze at that room for a second and I just feel this brush of cold air in front of my face. 

So naturally, I slam the door shut and step back to go get some of my black salt. I start sprinkling it around my room and everything and I just sit there and wait. I still hear loud noises outside my room door and everything and I'm just telling my friends what I'm hearing and they're all like ""make sure all your doors are closed and that your light is one"" that's already done so I just sit there and they tell me to just take my mind off of it, even though that was really hard. back then I occasionally got taps on my windows like someone was asking to be let in but that was really an occurrence when said creepy girl was still in the window. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after that night is just doesn't happen anymore but i make sure to keep that room door shut, kinda saying like ""oh sorry Jeffery but you can't come out"" and it still is hella abnormally cold around that room and in that room. 

&amp;#x200B;

the most recent occurrence was maybe like 6 months ago, but I just remember what the hell i was seeing that moment. 

So I was upstairs my mom puts my sisters to bed and opens that room door after putting some toys away.  I obviously kind of just nervous about this close the room door maybe like **a few hours later.** it's like 2 am and I'm chilling out in my room and I decide to go on a snack run and I find that the door I closed is OPEN. I chalk it up to my sisters even though I haven't heard their door open or close (it's loud and creaky as hell). So I just kinda shut it and then go downstairs to like get some snacks to bring back. I get upstairs with my snacks and the door is just open and the light is on. And I'm very just off-put by this so I turn off the light and shut the door and make sure I shut it good. 

And then I go to my sister's rooms and they are just dead asleep, so I'm like ""ooh Uhm?"" and I go back to my creeped out and kinda scared.  And so again I chalk it up to Jeffery and just like go back to chilling while eating. I start hearing more and more random noises coming from outside my door and well, I go get the little black salt I have remaining and just sprinkle it around my room again like I did that one time. And I'm a little less scared so I just go back to chilling despite being creeped out of my mind. 

I told my mom about it and she's just kinda like ""oh that's weird""

I do not hallucinate.

It was Christmas eve, 2019. I'd gotten into a drunken argument and had to spend 24 hours (Christmas day) in an empty, silent cell. I was hungover at the time, and had been beaten by the police for exercising in my cell. Well, after staring at the blank walls for so long, in a state of utter misery, I saw fairies. I do not believe in fairies, or anything else paranormal, and yet there they were, flying around my cell. Little female figures with dragonfly wings. They never spoke, qs dar as I can remember, they just flew around the room and I played with them. They were semi transparent, colourfuly dressed and I could not touch them. They are about the length of a hand. Around 10 inches roughly. They had came to keep me company and keep me sane, I decided. I saw them only for a minute or so and then they were gone.

Well, after this I decided they were merely figments of a traumatised and underestimated mind, and I never saw them again... until this morning, exactly 2 years later. 

I awoke this Christmas morning to the exact same fairies flying around my room. I saw one clearly. She smiled and flew around me and I remembered her like an old friend. My mother entered my room and in a haze I told her the fairies had come to visit again. She assumed I was dreaming but I was very much awake.

I suppose it could be some sort of trauma, as every Christmas eve since then, I've had nightmares of running from the police like I did that night. I like to consider rational explanations, but then, I'm starting to think I do believe in fairies.

Elementary students would rarely be allowed to walk in the junior high hallways unless it was absolutely necessary. Therefore multiple grades had one bathroom on their floor. My class was on the second floor of the school which meant my bathroom was at the end of that hallway. I remember it was lunch that day and the middle of winter so no one really wanted to go outside at least i didn’t. So me and my other two friends would always try and walk around to delay the time as much as possible. I needed to use the bathroom and because we were stalling the halls were pretty much empty since everyone had gone outside. I went into the bathroom and gave my jacket to my two friends to hold outside the bathroom. There was only four stalls at the end of the room and the sinks were right next to the stalls. Everything was all up against one side of the wall. That meant that when you stand right in front of the stalls, and look to your left you would see straight out into the hallway (which my friends were standing right at the doorway). I always had an eerie feeling when i went to the bathroom alone and what made it worse was that bloody mary was very popular during that time. So you would always see kids doing bloody mary in that bathroom and others trolling by turning off the lights. I decided to go into the very last stall so it was right against the wall. While I was doing my business i started hearing breathing, accompanied by what sounded like when someone sniffles if they have a runny nose. It sounded extremely close to me like literally right there or right next to me. I dont know if i was jus paranoid but I genuinely thought it was one of my friends trying to prank me. I even called out their name thinking that they entered the bathroom and literally stood right there. I even checked under my stall door for their legs but didnt see anything. I kept hearing it and at this point i got really spooked. But i still thought it was them because since the sinks were right next to the stall sometimes we’d hide behind the stall to scare our friends when they came to wash their hands. I slowly opened my door and did a peek before i even went out because i was that convinced they were trying to scare me. However I saw nothing and looked straight out into the hallway where i saw they had actually left my jacket on the floor. Now i was still convinced because i even did a peek around the corner where the sinks were ready to scare them back. I got chills the moment i realized i was really alone. i ran out grabbed my jacket off the ground and ran straight outside. When i found my friends they were all the way in the field of the playground meaning that was no way they could’ve been trying to scare me and instead ran out right away. Keep in mind we were two floors up and they weren’t even breathing heavily. I asked them about it and they said they didn’t even enter the bathroom.

I had no idea that the similar thing would happen to me. 

Now, let me clarify something. This is not made up. Although i have written a few r/nosleep stories, this is not fiction. This really happened to me and will probably happen again.

I've been looking for the right sub for this kind of post for almost an hour. I haven't found a better option so i decided to post here. 

Ok, so, it all started about two weeks ago. That was the first time i heard the whistle outside my house and it sounded like this:

*fweet fweet fwoot* 

Then, i didn't pay much attention. I thought that someone was just walking past my house and was in the mood for whistling. Nothing strange, right? Except it was past midnight.

I was lying on my bed and shortly after i fell asleep. Forgot about it tomorrow. 

The next day, i was in the bed again when i heard a similar whistle:

*fweet fweet fwoot*

I checked the time on my phone. 1:42 am. Strange. The whistle happened almost at the same time.

I think about it for a few seconds, i considered looking out the window, but the bed was too comfy and i decided to ignore it one more time.

The next day, something whistled again:

*fweet fweet fwoot*

I immediately checked the time. 1:46 am. I opened the notes app on my phone and wrote down when the whistles happened. 

I looked out the window. Nothing. The empty street and the sidewalk was everything i saw. Strange.

Fast forward ~14 days. To this point, I've heard the whistle every single night and always managed to note the time.

Another strange thing is that the latest whistle always comes 2-5 minutes later than the yesterday's whistle. So if it happened today at 2:10 am, it will happen tomorrow around 2:12 am. 

I've looked out the window almost every time and even went outside once. Nothing. 

I have also considered waiting for it outside after calculating when it's gonna happen but i don't like that idea.

It always sounds like it's coming from the west, 60 feet approximately. The next whistle will happen tonight in a few hours.

Can someone suggest anything? Like, should i just ignore it? 

I should also mention that i live alone and my neighbors are not the type of people who would prank me or something. I don't talk to them (or people in general) and i didn't ask them about the whistle. Should i? 

I will try to answer every question to provide more info.

 I have no idea what to do or how to get help, but I am at the end of my rope. There is some sort of entity that is attacking my family in our home. It started off with weird things happening around the house. Objects would go missing from where they were placed and end up somewhere completely different. The same pictures kept falling off the walls and breaking, even after being hung adequately in different parts of the house. My closet doors started opening and shutting on their own, even though there is no draft in the room. 

Recently, the activity has become more aggressive. My 8-year old son is completely terrified. He won’t sleep in his room anymore, so he’s been sleeping with me. Recently, the entity started making physical contact with us. Yesterday a fork flew off the table and hit the wall full force. It left a mark there. And this morning, when I woke up, I had a set of large scratches on my lower back that were bleeding.

I live with my 8 year-old son and he's absolutely terrified. He woke me up screaming a few nights ago, I ran into his room and there was an intense banging noise on his closet door. It was so loud, I could hear it from down the hall. I threw open the closet door, nothing was there. Except there was a piece of paper on the floor. It was a bible verse that my son had colored at church several years ago. I haven't seen it since we lived at our old house, and I have no idea where it came from or how it got there. He has been sleeping with me since that happened.

We are considering going to stay in a hotel for a while. Please, I need some advice on what to do. I can't live like this any longer. I am constantly in a state of fight or flight in my home. I have contacted a few different groups (investigators, mediums, clergy), but I haven't heard anything back yet. My family has been going through a hard time even before this started, but now it's completely unmanageable. I have been trying my best to ignore everything that happened, because I've heard that can make it go away. Things are only getting worse each week, and I don't know whether it's safe to stay in this house.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937537,public,new,self,Malevolent Spirit Terrorizing My Family,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rode8u/malevolent_spirit_terrorizing_my_family/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something like the USMLE in the United States. It is a big deal and everyone that goes into med school here knows that your future kind of depends on an exam score that takes place once a year.

My mom had died 3 years before i took that exam while i still was in med school, she was always a very caring person and was really proud of me, i am the youngest of 3 brothers and she alwas saw me as her little boy (even when i was 20 something). During med school i always wanted to become a nephrologist but after my mother passed away i went through a really bad episode of depression that made me pause my studies for 6 months and eventually made me change my specialty choice to psychiatry (after i realized the hell of mental illness and i wanted to help people not to go through that alone).

All those years i constantly felt the presence of my mother, like she was around in a good way always taking care of me. It is hard to explain but i just felt like she was still around somehow.

A few months before that big exam (i really put myself on studying for a year or so which is the usual time students prepare specifically for that exam) i had a dream in which i was taking that exam. The lady that gave the scores in the dream handed me my result and said ""You got a 76/100 but your mom graded your exam so it is a 86/100 now"". I woke up with a happy feeling since i thought it was funny and i enjoyed dreaming about my mom. I told my family about it but we really didn't think much of it.

The day i took my test i was feeling nervous but with enough confidence because i really had put myself into studying also i somehow felt that things were going to be okay.

After i finished my exam the lady that hands out the score prints out my results sheet, looks at it, then at me and says ""Congratulations, doctor"" (usually you need a score of 70 or more to get into a specialty but the better your score you can choose a better hospital to study at). So i take my results and to my surprise it says ""Total score: 86.00"". I was baffled. First of all because it was a really high score and later that day because when i was celebrating with my family we remembered that it was the exact same score of my dream. It is even more surprising because of the decimals. There are more than 450 questions on the exam so you can get scores like 74.36 or 82.72 or something. But this one was 86.00 to the point, like the dream months before where my mom graded my exam.

After that day which was 4 years ago i don't feel the presence of my mom as strong as before. I know she is there somehwere watching me and my family but i think she chose to stay a few years before leaving just to make sure i was ""going to do fine"" in life since that was one of her greatest worries as a mother in relation to me and my brothers.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937529,public,new,self,My mom got me into a medical residency after she died,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rocm32/my_mom_got_me_into_a_medical_residency_after_she/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve only ever mentioned it to my mum who has had strange experiences herself and who I know would believe it. 

Yesterday my parents and I were looking for a film to watch, and we settled on the Grudge. With all the spirits and entities in it, my mum and I began discussing strange things which have happened to us, for example stuff like footsteps we’ve heard. 

I live in an old hamlet, and up the road from me is an old manor. My dad is a history buff and when I was little we were driving home at night, and he stopped the car to look at it. I was in the back of the car and about a minute or so after we had stopped I looked out of the window, and a figure began to rise up in the dark. 

It wasn’t a very dark night and the headlights were somewhat lighting up the hedge, but this black figure rose up from the darkness against the hedge, facing my window. He had a helmet on, like a British WW1 soldier’s helmet. 

I was absolutely terrified at this point and I was screaming at my dad to drive. He drove off and we went home, but it’s always stuck with me. The manor near me is very old, like it dates back the 10th century and I know historically, people have died there. It’s documented online and in local history books. 

I researched it a few years back and discovered a medium went there. She said she felt or saw (I’m unsure of the correct terminology sorry) a woman waiting for her son to come back from the war, and her son walks the road leading to the manor searching for his mother. 

It’s always stuck with me as I was only 6 or 7 when it happened, and I’ve had other experiences since like hearing loud footsteps in my home. I can’t check the source again but like many other towns and villages, my parish lost many people during the war and we have a war memorial near the church.

I was a young child, probably 8. At the time, my family was very poor, we lived in my home country in Latin America.
I had this tiny bed next to my parents bed, their bed was in the middle of the room and mine was squeezed between their bed and the wall. On the other side of the room was a huge wooden and very old wall-to-wall vanity mirror. It was a very cramped room.

I remember suddenly waking up during the night, everyone was dead asleep, and it was dark but my vision was adapted enough to where I could see everything in the room.

What I saw was the silhouette of a lady brushing her hair. I stared at her for a bit, assuming it was my mom, but I remember asking myself why she would brush her hair in the dark.
I repeatedly said “Mom?” Until I heard a lazy-half asleep response, like a “Hmm?”
“Are you awake?” A half-asleep “I am now” “Are you brushing your hair?” 
A weirded out “…No?”
The lady was still brushing her hair.
I was already terrified, but maybe she was lying? Trying to get me to fall asleep?
So, I asked for her hand (I used to fall asleep only if I could doze off while I held her hand so she was used to reaching towards my bed)

To my shock and horror, her hand did reach me, and I held it, all the while staring at the silhouette lady brush her hair. I remember my heart beating faster and faster, and I must’ve fainted because I suddenly shot up, wide awake the next day, late into the day aswell, with the lights on and with one in the room.

Now, I thought about this for a bit as a kid and eventually forgot about it. I moved to the US and now, recently a friend asked me if I had any paranormal experiences and this memory resurfaced. I assumed it was a dream, however, I visited my mom that day and mentioned this “dream” to my mom, she told me that she remembered that conversation we had..?

I was surprised but she kindof brushed it aside with a “Huh, how about that.” As she’s used to the paranormal things back home, brujeria and such.

\*This is a real story and I wouldn't consider this extremely paranormal but thought to share it here, long post

7 years back, my dad along with his 2 brothers decided that they will collectively built a 3 stored building, so we were searching for rented houses to live in, his 2 brothers found their respective rented houses but since they're so far away from the location of our building which is being constructed, they asked my dad to find a nearby house(since he needs to regularly check whether the builders and their workers are doing their job right or not, in my country they're not trusted), after a while, we finally found it, it's owners were very kind, Husband and Wife living alone on 1st floor, they gave the ground floor, in it they're 3 rooms, first 2 rooms are quite near connected by a single bathroom but the third room is the last corner of the house, my parents and I occupied the first two rooms while my sister occupied the third room.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all that third room always remain quite cold as compared to other rooms we deduced maybe it's due to not proper sunlight entering into the room, after 2-3 months in that house, a series of terrible things start happening to us, my mom got diagnosed with Tuberculosis, she later slips into depression, my sister experienced intense sleep paralysis in that room multiple times, one of the most horrifying ones happened to her as this: my dad always use to wake up my sister at 5AM for her college (she used to leave the home at 6:30 for her college bus), so that day she felt that someone had touched her to wake up, she thought it was dad, so she did but when she saw no one and saw the time it was around 4AM, she thought it was her mistake by her part, so she slept again but this time, she wasn't been able to move her entire body and she saw a black figure coming towards her, then she felt like that black figure was trying to choke her breathing, after minutes of struggle, she become 'normal' and ran to my parents room.

&amp;#x200B;

As everyone said it's normal ""sleep paralysis"" I started to sleep with her, but I started get horrible nightmares there like me killing myself in dreams. Sometimes I woke up midnight and Istg I felt intense goosebumps and sort of constant vibration like my body is indicating something is not right there? We abandoned that room after that day and used to start sleeping with my parents, some months before shifting to our newly constructed home, my father got diagnosed with prostate cancer (he died last month...).

My father was in the military and was often at TDY when this happened. 
Our house is a two-story building where 2 bedrooms and the kitchen is on the 2nd story. A guest bedroom (my mother's sewing room at the time) and the bathroom is on the 1st floor. 

The first time it happened I remember my mom being in the kitchen sewing as I was with her watching and learning how to use it in the future. During the break of the loud machine we heard a very distinct child crying downstairs on the first floor. It was pretty late in the day and our neighbors all had kids around my age (I believe I was 7-10. Sorry it's been so long since this happened) I remember a chill running up my spine and my mom going silent. I looked at her and she said ""don't worry it's the neighbor kids."" 

The second time it happened we were once again upstairs in the kitchen. I was now in middle school so 12-13. Our neighbors were throwing a party (they were some big fancy hockey players for the Alaska team) so all we could hear was the muffle sounds of music and people drunkenly chattering away next door, but again clearly and loudly coming from our 1st floor we heard a child crying. This time my mom looked at me and panicked ""what was that..."" and I remember looking at her and told her ""the neighbors are throwing a party. They must have a baby."" 
I don't know why I said that when we both knew exactly that the cries were in the house. They were never muffled and our windows were never open because it was always around winter. To this day I don't know what it was. I still live in the house but my room has now moved to the first floor. I don't feel anything ominous or eery, but sometimes I always wonder what it was and it has never happened again since.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937466,public,new,self,Baby is Crying Downstairs,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/ro6zo4/baby_is_crying_downstairs/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A little back story, I (22F) grew up in this old Victorian house with my mom and grandparents until I was 4 years old. During the time I lived at this house, from what my mom and grandma tell me, I would always stare at this toy spider that I had my ceiling for hours, I had an “imaginary friend” that I would always talk to, my closet door would shake in the middle of the night and just other small coincidences that are unexplainable. Side note, my mom mentions often that I was a very clumsy child and I always had bruises all over me which could be related to later in the story.

Once I moved out with my mom and step dad there wasn’t anything more paranormal that happened until we moved into a house that my parents bought on a lot (a modular home that they had placed on land they bought). Nothing major, but I had a butterfly that hung from my ceiling next to the door in my room and at odd times it would start to move (no it wasn’t when the air was on or someone opened the door or anything like that, just at random times it would move), I was never too spooked by it though. Also during this time I acquired a doll who ended up giving me the creeps and bad dreams then fell on my face out of nowhere and gave me a black eye. 

Flash forward a couple years I’ve moved out of my parents and lived in a couple different houses, then I move into a 5 bedroom house with a bunch of friends. Place was definitely haunted, I could go on and on about all the different things that happened there, but the weird thing was things would only happen when other people were around, but when I was alone nothing ever happened to me. One example is me and 4 other people who lived in the house were all sitting upstairs in our living room talking when out of nowhere you hear what sounds like someone running up the stairs full sprint and when we all look over to the stairs, knowing no one was downstairs, and see nothing, we all go to investigate and can’t find anything that would’ve made the noises we all heard at the exact same time. But then once I was alone nothing would happen. The only strange thing that happened to me is I would get the most random bruises on my legs and I would have no idea where they came from. It would be one thing to have one here and there but my legs always had at least 5 different bruises on them at all times and I would have no recollection of how I got them.

My roommates made a metal coat hanger in the shape of an L and when you held it out you would ask which way is yes and the hanger would turn right or left and then you would ask it yes or no questions and it would answer. Well every time I tried it, it would never work for me but always worked for all of my roommates. I suppose I’ve just never felt very connected to paranormal activity like I believe it but maybe deep down I don’t and that’s why it doesn’t associate with me? 

I lived in two other places before moving to our current home and had a few very small instances, at one house in the middle of the night heard a consistence tapping noise on the wall behind when I turned around to look it immediately stopped, then at the next place had things like the wifi randomly unplugging from the wall or this “little star” lettered sign (like happy birthday banners on string and the letters move) we had on the wall, the letters would flip and move around randomly. 

Flash forward to the present, my husband, brand new baby boy and I are back into the house I was raised in since my grandparents both passed and we’re working on saving some money. Since living here again I definitely notice things that are..off. Things moving, odd sounds, bruises are back all over my legs, I get scratches I know nothing about, but for the most part nothing too crazy. My husband and I invite some friends over and they refuse to go into 90% of the rooms, one of them is throwing up and crying when I move a piece of furniture they tell me to get rid of because they get real bad juju from and since have refused to come back except to help me remove the old antiques from the house and to cleanse it. Like they were straight terrified to be in this house.  

So my question is this, considering I’ve had paranormal experiences my whole life but I don’t necessarily feel it or I am unable to communicate with it, what are some theories for me and how do I cleanse myself from anything that may be following me? 

Another side note, and if you’re still here know I appreciate you, my mom and uncle have worked in the mortuary business since I can remember and for about a year until I got pregnant I worked removing people after they passed and I don’t personally think anyone in my family has been directly affected by paranormal, (except earlier this year when my grandma passed my mom has experienced some unexplainable things in her home) but I do feel that we have a sort of bad luck streak if that matters any. 

I appreciate anyone who gives advice and it feels good getting all this out in the open to get my thoughts out there and hopefully get some sort of idea on what I could be dealing with.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937445,public,new,self,Could something be following me?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/ro5h8n/could_something_be_following_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've had a few experiences, normally they'd be pretty big ones but always happened few and far between. My family lives on an old farm, 15 1/2 acres, pretty big with forests and a very nice place with three main barns. One is the red barn, we built half of it into an actual house and still use part of it for sheep, it's the newest barn on the area, the black barn, very old and worn down, we keep extra wood and stuff in there, and lastly, the house barn. The house barn is the oldest, over 500 years old and when it was built it used absolutely no nails. 

That was just for setting up the area, now onto what I think has been decently active activity. The first encounter I had a few years ago, it was pretty late and I was about to go to sleep from watching a movie, I looked over onto the other couch across from me for the controller, and watched it turn from being horizontal, to vertical and face me. It moved incredibly slowly and just... Odd. Nothing I can really think of that was a large event happened before what I think is the biggest one I've had. I had  been trying to sleep, only my mom was home and I knew she hadn't left her room when I hear someone try to open my door, like they had been rattling with the knob. My door doesn't shut properly or lock, and was easily able to be pushed open, then, in my mom's voice and perfectly monotone I hear; Help, help me.  That's what got me, and suddenly it just stopped.

I hear heavy footsteps walk around, lights turn on after I know i'd left them off, dogs barking at nothing and getting bad vibes or suddenly getting super cold in one area. With the history of our farm I'd have to assume that maybe its an Amish spirit who died working on the barn, but I also have neighbors just down our old gravel road, who I happen to be friends with one of the kids, and their older sister is an occultist and has done many spells in there house, and recently she apparently let something loose. 

My main worry is that this could be evil or a type of mimic, as it seems to be attached to my mom, who's heard her name be called through out the house when she's alone or in bed, and no one who lives at my house calls her by her name, we just say mom. I've heard many coyotes almost truly right outside my window, yet the dogs never bark which make me think they might be scared of it. 

I honestly don't know, I'd like to figure it out and see if there is even one spirit here or any at all, I'm pretty paranoid about these sorta things and don't want anything to happen and would be very open to suggestions.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937370,public,new,self,I think my house is haunted and I don't know what to do,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/ro0f4r/i_think_my_house_is_haunted_and_i_dont_know_what/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Producers will add and take away from the true story to appeal more to the audience.  There was a man who wrote a book about his abusive father, and his publisher told him to make up more gruesome details in order to sell more books.

The movie and the book ""The Exorcist"" was loosely based on the true story of Ronald Edwin Hunkeler, a 14-year-old boy of Cottage City, Maryland who experienced several exorcisms during his life.  Although there are commonalities between his true life and the movie ""The Exorcist"", there is one important fact they failed to mention.

Ronald Hunkeler became possessed in 1949 after the death of his paternal aunt, Tilly.   Aunt Tilly was a spiritualist who showed him how to used an Ouija board to communicate with otherworldly spirits, and his mom was worried that the strange happenings around Ronald were because of the use of the Ouija board.  Hunkeler underwent a sequence of medical and psychological exams, which didn’t discover anything irregular.  Although the family was Lutheran, they ended up calling in Franciscan priests from the Catholic church.

After Ronald was free of possession, he became a successful engineer at NASA; however, he  would always have the memories of the almost 30 exorcisms.  This case shows us how dangerous it is to use the Ouija board.

My son was five. His eyes were glassy and he was talking gibberish. It took us a few minutes to realize what was going on. 

Anyway, I just remember that the first occurrence of his sleep walking occurred right after his little brother was born. Now, I’m left wondering if he had been responsible for a smaller child in a previous life.

Due to it’s heritage status it’s taken the developers over a decade to get the required permits, after it was finally deemed “unsafe”. The brick along the outside and the walls of the foundation is all that remains from the original house.

Me and my coworker spent most our time in the basement installing the furnace, we were the only 2 on site for the duration. Multiple times I would see him walking into a room out of my peripheral vision, I’d  ask him something before discovering the room is empty. I didn’t think much of it as the place was messy and the lighting was bad. 

Then I began noticing footsteps, distinctively the sound of work boots on plywood. It didn’t catch my attention until one day I heard them right above me, and my coworker was in the basement with me (on concrete). We went up to check who it was, just to find out no one  else was on site. Thats when I noticed the steel strapping hanging in the same spot I heard the footsteps, was swinging despite not being touched in 20-30min.

[video of steel strapping.](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIPlXXfc)

Finding it a bit creepy, my coworker then tells me the framers were frequently hearing footsteps and voices while tearing out the original framing, etc. I instantly start telling him about the things I’ve been seeing in my peripherals. It was never something still, but always a walking motion which makes me believe I was seeing something.

Luckily all of this occurred at the end of the day since we weren’t in the mood to stay much longer. We packed our power tools and decided to leave everything else over night, getting out as quick as possible. On our way out we noticed my hammer was no longer in the basement with the rest of my tools. It was hanging exactly where I heard the foot steps coming from, swinging just like the steel strapping was.

7 years back, my dad along with his 2 brothers decided that they will collectively built a 3 stored building, so we were searching for rented houses to live in, his 2 brothers found their respective rented houses but since they're so far away from the location of our building which is being constructed, they asked my dad to find a nearby house(since he needs to regularly check whether the builders and their workers are doing their job right or not, in my country they're not trusted), after a while, we finally found it, it's owners were very kind, Husband and Wife living alone on 1st floor, they gave the ground floor, in it they're 3 rooms, first 2 rooms are quite near connected by a single bathroom but the third room is the last corner of the house, my parents and I occupied the first two rooms while my sister occupied the third room, first of all that third room always remain quite cold as compared to other rooms we deduced maybe it's due to not proper sunlight entering into the room, after 2-3 months in that house, a series of terrible things start happening to us, my mom got diagnosed with Tuberculosis, she later slips into depression, my sister experienced intense sleep paralysis in that room multiple times, one of the most horrifying ones happened to her as this: my dad always use to wake up my sister at 5AM for her college (she used to leave the home at 6:30 for her college bus), so that day she felt that someone had touched her to wake up, she thought it was dad, so she did but when she saw no one and saw the time it was around 4AM, she thought it was her mistake by her part, so she slept again but this time, she wasn't been able to move her entire body and she saw a black figure coming towards her, then she felt like that black figure was trying to choke her breathing, after minutes of struggle, she become 'normal' and ran to my parents room, as everyone said it's normal ""sleep paralysis"" I started to sleep with her, but I started get horrible nightmares there like me killing myself in dreams.

I'm new here and I wanted to see if anyone has had any similar experiences to ours.

We have this phenomena that happens usually a couple times a month where the house we're renting is surrounded by blue lights. I recently started posting webcam videos to youtube of our experiences. I have about 6 different videos of the activity some from the side yard and some very interesting ones from the back. It's a very old house that's part of an old family farm.

We've also heard voices in the house and have decided not to run the webcam inside the house until we're ready to move because we really don't want to see that yet, a couple voices is enough. The cats don't seem to be bothered at all, so there's that.

Blue light is supposed to be very spiritual and good, but Idk about all this.

We are super curious to learn anything we can about the activity.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?   Our videos are titled Peaceful Valley Lights",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937256,public,new,self,Peaceful Valley Lights,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rnpdqh/peaceful_valley_lights/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His aunty was maybe 11-13 at the time not too sure but she was terminally ill, can’t remember with what sorry. Anyways the crying went on for like 2 weeks and when we asked him what’s wrong every time he would never answer, after confirming it’s nothing health related I started to become concerned it could be something spiritual because every time his mom would start praying he would stop crying. 

Now I started to getting really angry I’m not religious so I didn’t resolve to praying, I tried contacting people who I thought might have an idea as to what was happening but one night I sent a message out to the universe aiming at whoever the fuck was attacking my child and I didn’t care in what plane they were, I fucking meant it I was gonna get to the bottom of this.

The very next night it happened again this time it was bad n she kept repeating “I want the coffin” and mind you I don’t think she even knew what a coffin was at the time, her mom kept praying as usual until it finally stopped, the next day I heard her aunty had died that same night and ever since he never woke up crying anymore. 

I didn’t continue to find out what was happening to him because he was good now but I still wonder what was really going on if anyone has an idea as to what was happening or have a similar experience I’d love to hear.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937254,public,new,self,Son connection to terminally ill Auntie,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rnpag9/son_connection_to_terminally_ill_auntie/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our room was on the bottom floor and looked out into the forest. My brother and I shared a room and bed on the other side of the kitchen/ living room from my parents. I had made it my nightly ritual to go out onto the deck and smoke some weed once everyone was sleep. On the third night I finished smoking and got into bed next to my brother. Before I could fall asleep I was startled by the sound of stomping around and banging cupboards coming from the kitchen. Though it was around 2am, I figured it was one of my parents up for a late night snack. I was a bit scared so I immediately opened the bedroom door to confirm that it was one of my parents. As soon as I opened the door the noises stopped and there was nobody in sight. I knew there wouldn’t have been enough time between the door opening and me entering for my parents to go back to their room. I froze in shock for a second, not believing the situation, then snapped out of it and jumped back into my bed, closing the door behind me. Being high, I tried to reason with myself that I was just imagining things but that’s when the noises got louder. It sounded like someone was angrily stomping around the living room and I could hear them as they moved towards and away from my door. During this whole time my brother was fast asleep so I shook him awake, whispering the details of the situation in a panic. He was groggy but understood something was wrong. He pulled the covers over himself and cowered in fear. After a bit longer of the stomping the noise stopped and I checked to see that my brother had already fallen back asleep. Then, the part that still haunts me to this day began. I heard thundering footsteps quickly approaching the room and the BAM! The locked door was hit with massive force and somehow was set ajar. I’ve never felt more fear than peering into that crack in the door wondering what caused it to open. I then hid under the covers, curled up into a ball and fell asleep. The only thing I have to confirm it wasn’t a dream is the fact that in the morning the door was still open in the same position.

To this day I’m still confused about what exactly happened, but I have a strong suspicion that it was something paranormal.

First one was in Gettysburg. Hot summers day and I fell a sleep under the statue of a Union General. I don't think I've ever felt so serene and at peace with the world. This was about 20 years ago. I've googled the statue and I think it was either Reynolds or Hancock. 

Other time was off the shore of a Loch near Inverness.

Other was on some ruins in Rome.

The Gettysburg one was the weirdest.

We lived in a three room house which they had the far left room and i took the room at the end of the hallway to the right hand side of the house and the other room was a spare bedroom where people can crash for the night. I would come home a bit late sometimes and wouldnt make it back home till where my mother was asleep or just about to sleep when i would go to the gym. During one particular week a couple months before i moved out from living with my mother i had some unexplained things happened.  

1. I came back home to the gym tired as hell it was around 11ish usually the time when my mother would be asleep or about to start getting stuff ready for her work day a bit before. When i walked in I heard walking in the kitchen going into the spare bedroom where there is a door to go into the spare bedroom. I started following it because i thought it was my mother and also because i always used to walk that way because there is two doors in the spare bedroom one going to the kitchen and one leading to the hallway that connects also my room and my moms room so it would be more quiet since its closer to my room. when i finally get to the doorway transition from kitchen to spare room the footsteps stop and im also in the complete dark and when they stopped i also noticed my mom and stepdad's loud but nothing out of the ordinary snoring. Thats when it dawned on me that it was no one i knew or no one there to be making walking noises.

KEEP IN MIND the house has old wooden floors so you can hear every step super loud except for tile in the kitchen but even in the kitchen i heard the walking going to the spare room. 

 2. After i told my mother this she told me it was weird because around the same week when she was home and i was at work and my stepdad was on his way back from work and she was alone and she heard a loud sound like if someone threw something hard against the floor. when she went into my room(which i didn't like her doing in general) she checked my whole room because she was freaked nothing was on the floor or nothing fell.

3.When it was around 1-2 in the morning i heard a kid in a little kids voice say ""Hello?!"" one day which scared me so bad i didn't sleep at all that night.

after those incidents since my room was at the back corner of the house facing the backyard, which keep in mind my stepdads house has a huge backyard, i would hear a bunch of walking noises and noises of my stepdads old fence that would surround the house.

I cannot explain how these things happened and it still sends shivers down my spine a bit as i think about it and i could just be a skeptic which in some ways i am but i heard this stuff clear as day so it has me scratching my head.

After such positive feedback from the community I decided I’d write a few additional pieces about my and my family’s experiences. I apologize in advance if the descriptive details are reiterated, but I feel they’re necessary to depict my person experiences on this forum. Here is what I call the “First Occurrence” to my original true story of A Haunting in Rural Utah:

In 2008 I was living in Monroe, UT located in the heart of central Utah. My family had moved here just before the Great Recession and had purchased my grandparent’s home on Foothill Drive for a few years before selling it back to them. This home had been a part of our family since my grandparents had built it back in 1996. At this point in time I was living in this home with my mother, my step dad, and my sister. My mother owned a small business and was constantly working in a town about 15 minutes north of Monroe while my step dad would work varying hours through the day/night in that same town. I was a freshman at this time and my sister was about 8 years old.

Our house was perched atop a hill that overlooked the little valley of Monroe and faced west into the sunset, while the back of the home was backed up against the Monroe Mountain. The home was quite large, and my room was one of the first rooms you’d be greeted with when walking directly up the stairs. It was joined to my sister’s bedroom via a Jack &amp; Jill bathroom where we shared a common shower.

Each day after school I’d immediately come home and shower, which was habitual because in the spring season I played tennis, so even on the offseason this was habitual for me. When I got home I’d immediately go upstairs to show and my Yorkshire Terrier would follow me around as a last resort because despite her disdain for me she enjoyed my company (I’d always tease this poor dog). She’d simply lay on the bathroom rug come hell or high water and would scratch at the door if I didn’t let her in, so it was second nature to let her follow me into the bathroom. On this particular day I was showering when a cracking noise came from my sister’s side of the bathroom. I didn’t think anything of it and just assumed my sister was home and yelled out, “Hey Sarah!” while the shampoo worked it’s way into my eye causing me to wince. There was no response. I figured she didn’t hear me. Seconds later I heard several knocking/banging noises on my sister’s bathroom door. Immediately our dog Phoebe went off the rails and starts barking and growling (which is typical for a terrier). “I’ll be out in a sec what do you need?” The knocking continued and yet there was no response. Just weeks before this occurrence my sister had cut open her hand on a can opener while I was in the shower and was begging for me to help her, so I was concerned she got herself into trouble again and didn’t think twice about the situation. Despite having shampoo in my eye I got out of the shower while the water was running and quickly wrapped a towel around my body and opened the door. There was nobody there. The silence coming from my sister’s bedroom and her side of the bathroom was deafening despite the shower running behind me. My dog stood there and didn’t step forward like she normally would’ve to greet my sister. I immediately called my parents who confirmed they were out of town at this point, and then followed up with my sister when she got home later that evening, but she assured me she was at her friend’s house in another small town just outside of Monroe. To this day I have no clue what it was that banged on the door. 

This was my first occurrence with what I believe to be the supernatural, and ironically this was about the same time my immediate family started to unravel. I say this because years later it seemed that the two were intertwined. Stay tuned for “The Second Occurrence” which I’ll post this weekend after Christmas.

We had a particular pod that was overflow for solitary confinement (23 hour lock down with 1 hour of free time). This unit was fairly dark, quite aside from the occasional inmate screaming expletives at the detention officers as they walked by every 30 minutes or so conducting a security tour. I feel it is important to describe the pod's set up as its unique to the other three pods on that floor. This pod was set up to hold 80 inmates with partition walls separating every 20 rooms or so. The portion of the pod where the inmates were held were two floors, the upper floor was more of a mezzanine with a simple guard rail and a single set of stairs leading up to it. There was no cage or fence preventing anyone from jumping over the rail and experiencing a 20 foot drop to sudden stop onto the concrete floor below (this is important for later). The pod itself was generally rather dark, cold, and mostly dead silent. The atmosphere was pretty depressing even just for us officers. With that being said, it shouldn't be too surprising that the pod was notorious for suicide attempts and a few successes.   


When Covid had made its way to the states we ended up converting the unit to a quarantine unit for violent crimes or crimes against a minor. All of those solitary confinement inmates were either transferred to the Special Housing Unit (SHU- pronounced shoe), had their cases re-examined by our in house judge, or dropped entirely (The Covid pandemic was an interesting time to work in a jail). After the transition took place all of the violent criminals/gang affiliated/crimes against children inmates would be required to be quarantined in this pod for two weeks before being transferred to another part of the jail to await trial. In August of 2020 roughly 1700 hours (5 pm) I relieved the day shift officers of the pod. At that time it was our policy that out of the 20 rooms in the 4 separated sections of the pod only 4 inmates were to be allowed out for their 1 hour of free time. The inmates could use this time to shower, call out from the phones in the common area, watch T.V. or utilize the outside recreation area. I and one other officer from my shift conducted our mandatory guard tour of all 4 sections. We decided that it would be ideal that I take two sections and my other officer take the other two to split the work load. My tour was rather un-eventful however my partner claimed that on his tour he overheard a inmate talking to his assumed mother in a rather irate and panicked voice. Neither one of us really thought of anything of it as he wasn't saying anything to be of concern but as it came close for that particular group to go back to their rooms so the next group of 4 inmates could come out we observed this inmate walk up the stairs and stand in front of his room facing the officers station. After about a minute of standing there staring at us officers from the second floor I keyed the intercom system for that section to inform him that free time was over and he needed to enter his room so I could pop out the next group for their free time. After I finished saying what I said this inmate climbed the guard rail and stood on the top most rung of the rail and proceeded to jump head first onto the concrete floor below.  


Me and the officer I was working the pod with bolted into the section where the inmate jumped, notifying both our superiors and the medical staff for a 1089 (suicide attempt) in the process. When we entered the section not only did we not see a body, but the room with the open door was completely empty. Both me and the fellow officer I worked with looked at each other in shear confusion because we both seen this happen. About 8 inmates housed on the second floor were going wild, screaming that a man jumped (at this time of the 20 rooms only 11 were occupied for that section). That makes 10 people who watched a man who looked just as real as anyone I've ever met climb the rail and jump. None of the people on the bottom floor seen anything but the 8 on the second floor witnessed it. When my Lieutenant and the medical staffed arrived both me and the other officer were running around the pod trying to find where this man went. About 45 minutes of trying to explain to my lieutenant and the medical staff of what we witnessed and interviewing the 8 inmates who seen it also my lieutenant finally agreed to roll back the cameras for that section. In the video there was no one at the phones despite clearly seeing my partner look at the phone, pause and carry on as if he was looking at someone. The camera only had what appeared to be a very faint orb like object move from the phones, up the stairs and it disappeared near the opened door. When we rolled the video back further to when day shift released 3 inmates the empty room door opened as well but no one exited. when we went back and looked at the meal sheet (a sheet we had at the officers station cataloging the rooms that were occupied) the room was blank.   


When we investigated further, A inmate accused of raping an 8 year old boy was housed in that same exact room. This inmate was also known to frequently use the phones to call his mother and get into heated arguments over money. This inmate committed suicide in the exact same manor over 4 years prior on the day, on that exact time. To this day it remains the most compelling proof of hauntings to me. I refused to ever work that post again for the remainder of my time working there and pretty much everyone who has worked that pod has had varying degrees of paranormal activities. empty rooms having their doors opened despite no one actually unlocking the door, voices, screams, and the showers turning on randomly.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,937158,public,new,self,The pod of ghastly inmates,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rnf4v5/the_pod_of_ghastly_inmates/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this day during the year of 1776 a young German boy was far away from home.  He wore a mans war uniform that hung around his small body.  The boy was a hessian soldier, brought to this strange new world by the British, to help fight their war.  In this cold and unfamiliar land the boy was dying.  He lay in the American troops barracks bleeding slowly from a large wound in his chest.   The heat from a fireplace gave small kisses of warmth to his tear stained cheeks.  By Christmas Day the boy was dead- but his story was not over.  His restless spirit missed his home, his mother, the life he gave for others.

To preface, I’m a preschool teacher and our school is pretty outdated where you can hear the pipes creaking when a toilet flushes. My classroom had just opened in Summer 2021 after being closed for a year due to Covid-19. I had always felt “off” when entering the classroom and I had always brushed it off as me adjusting to a new school and a new classroom. Whenever I walk in, my eyes always gravitate towards the bathroom.

Yesterday, the kids were getting settled for naptime and we turn the lights off. One of my students was drying his hands and he was facing towards the bathroom, shaking and nodding his head as if he was having a conversation with someone. Nobody was in the restroom, so I asked who he was talking to. He looked at me, looked back at the bathroom, shook his head and went to his bed. That same day, I was closing up the classroom and it was now 5:30pm. As I shut off the light and closed the door, I saw an orb(?) or  a speck of light above the box that controls the ac/heater. It was weird because there was nothing that can reflect light in that area and the lights outside of the classroom were too dim to even reach that wall.

There will be days where some of my students would refuse to use the restroom and I have this specific student who’s such a ball of sunshine and loves playing with me, but lately he’s been following me around the classroom with a scared expression on his face. I’ve also heard knocking and thumping on the windows and doors when there’s no wind and it’s usually just me on that side of the school. 

It’s been weird recently and I’m not sure how to feel.

I understand telling stories over the internet brings about questions of authenticity and truthfulness about the teller/user/whatever I am. It’s impossible to tell if the story is made up or not which I fully understand and I don’t expect you to believe me. Just hear me out and think for yourselves. That’s all I ask. Maybe even saying all that makes it seem fishy.

A couple years ago my girlfriend and I decided to make a 2 week trip out to Washington state. We didn’t plan anything out we just figured it out along the way. We first visited Yakima, then traveled to Seattle, then went to Olympia, then Bremerton, then Forks, and ended up deciding to go to Ho Forest National Park. I don’t want to drag on about everything we did before “it” happened because I don’t find it applicable to the story (I can if you think it may apply to the story in the comment section later). Anyway, when we were navigating to Ho Forest somehow we go lost. We ended up going about 20 miles off track and ended up, in what looked like, a tree logging operation area. There were a bunch of wide open sections with tree stumps as far as the eye could see. As we were driving through this area the sun was setting. I don’t know exactly what time this happened but off in the distance (100-125 yards) I could see movement off of the left side of the road. Whatever it was, it was moving fast. It was running from the left side of the road to the right side (if that makes sense) At first I thought it was a bear, once it crossed the road was when I got really confused. IT WAS RUNNING ON ITS HIND LEGS! I watched it for around 15 seconds before it disappeared into the Forest. It had to be running at least 30 mph or more. It might’ve been a bear but I don’t know if they can run that fast on their hind legs or if they do that at all.

However, around my birthday the senior year of high school, the girl who asked what her death date would be died in a single vehicle car accident. It was a shock to everyone.

We got our current dog, N, late last January, and our previous dog, S, passed away early last December. M passed away in 2015 and E has been dead for over 15 years now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm spending Christmas with my parents as always. Last year, early Christsmas eve morning my father showed me an interesting finding; he had found some of M's fur on our foyer's carpet, just ouf of nowhere. She had black fur, all of our other dogs have been yellow, so it was easy to recognize. We had kept some of her fur before she passed to compare it to as well. No other animals had visited us previously either. It was definitely her fur. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was a nice reminder since that was our first Christmas without S. M and S used to be friends before M passed, M being the strong-willed and feisty leader of those two. We speculated it might have fallen from our Christmas decoration box and we just hadn't noticed it earlier. Strange, but comforting. We joked around that M had paid us a visit. We cleaned the Christmas decoration box just in case and didn't find fur or anything out of place in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Just now I was decorating the tree with my mother. I noticed a white piece of something on the kitchen table before we brought the Christmas decoration box in, but didn't pay it any attention; I thought it was a dried up piece gum that my mom eats or something. Later however I inspected it closer and noticed that it was too hard to be dried up gum. I flipped it around and came to a quick conclusion; it was a tooth. Presumably a dog's tooth, at least it was not a human tooth. It looked slightly old AND it was smaller than any of our labrador's teeth would have been. I even asked my father if he had brought it in from the outside but he hadn't seen it before. Our dog's N's mouth is not bleeding, missing any teeth nor was the tooth bloody or even moist from slober; furthermore, it is too small to be his tooth. It does feel like a real tooth to me too as I have inspected animal teeth before.

&amp;#x200B;

Once is a happenstance, twice is a coincidence.. Guess we will have to wait until next Christmas to see if three is a pattern and if we'll get a third reminder of M. Never before the passing of S did we find anything like this. Do you have any thoughts on this?

So I need to add a bit of background to this first: I've had a friend for about 14 years now who is a witch (I don't know much about the occult/witchcraft so cant answer many questions on that, but will try) and he has had a crush on me since day one, I've told him many time that I'm flattered, but not interested in guys and for the most part he's been fine with it.

The problems started about a year ago when I got into a serious relationship, he was not happy about this and was not a fan of my girlfriend and our relationship at all sending me messages that she isn't good for me and that he promises things will be bad etc.

He invited us to both join a DnD campaign he was running and we agreed as I love DnD and my GF was very keen to learn/share in my interests and hobbies. We played for a couple of weeks when he asked my GF is she would pain a box of his miniatures no problem, right?

The next session he just killed off my character and ended the campaign abruptly after my GF mentioned she wont be able to join due to Covid and concerns for het sickly father (This was in the beginning of 2021 when we had a second wave in my country)

This is where the the weirdness begins, my GF is pretty sensitive to things and she asked me to come get the box of miniatures as it was ""giving her bad vibes"" I brought it home and immediately on seeing it my elderly mother who lives with me refused that I bring it inside the house for the same reason ""It doesn't feel right"" 

I left the box in the garage

That night both myself and my girlfriend started having horrible nightmares of the other cheating or generally bad things in our relationship this continued for a month or two where we both had re-occurring dreams, I spoke to a priest friend of mine who advised I return the box. I returned it nd he blesse the house and the dreams stopped.

The weird happening started though, everyone in my house has been experiencing strange or odd things since then, my mother felt someone grabbing her shoulder and when she turned thinking it was me, saw nobody in the room, I have had on multiple nights heard knocks and bangs on my on-suite bathroom door and windows at night  as well as my bathroom door ""shaking"" like someone was trying to open it all while nobody was outside or in the bathroom, my GF has seen a shadowy figure slowly walk past my window at night, my nephew heard someone whispering his name in his ear when visited and I've seen what looked like a young girl peeking at me from the staircase and now the nightmares have started up again, with me waking up screaming last night and seeing a dark figure next to my bed that immediately disappeared. Due to the because the stress and nightmares my relationship is taking serious strain to the point of us going to couples therapy. 

So my question is: Am I dealing with something paranormal? Did my friend put a spell on us/that box? Or is it all just in our heads? 

I really would appreciate some help or advice on this, my priest friend has unfortunately moved to Sweden (We're in the southern hemisphere) so he cant help me out.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936909,public,new,self,Help/Advice needed with possible paranormal/demonic activity,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rmtame/helpadvice_needed_with_possible_paranormaldemonic/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Back in 2011 I was living in a rural town called Monroe, UT finishing up my senior year in HS. Monroe is a town of around 2,000 residents and is home to one of the largest mountains in Utah, which my grandparent’s house (where I was living at the time) resided at the base of. Our house was on the top of a foothill and overlooked the quaint Monroe Valley. 
The house itself was about 3500 sq. ft. with an entryway/foyer that was approx 25 ft high and had a front room on either side of the entry way and then the main living room and kitchen towards the back of the house facing the mountain. The upstairs had three bedrooms, a small library, and then a balcony overlooking the foyer. The basement was a house itself complete with 3 bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen (hopefully this paints y’all a picture of the setting).
At this point in my life my grandpa had been recently diagnosed with cancer. Because we didn’t have a hospital in the area with an adequate treatment center, my grandparents temporarily moved to southern Utah where there was a hospital and left me with the house to finish off my high school graduation and part of the summer (May - July). Because of this, my house was notorious for having the boys over where we’d have parties and then play massive games of hide and seek in the dark (sounds childish but man it was fun). I was also keen on having my friends over at all times because being alone in a large home is creepy sometimes and also because I had several encounters with spirits at one point in my life when I was living with my mom (but that story is for another time). Anyway, I didn’t want to be alone in the house and preferred having people over.
Well right around the middle of June I had two of my best friends over (let’s call them Jake and Sam) and each of us had a girl over and had picked a room to hang out with them. If you’re a religious person then you probably believe that certain activities aren’t necessarily inviting of the Holy Ghost.. and let’s just say my two friends and their girls at my place were doing what would be considered uninviting of the Holy Spirit lol. I was with my best friend’s sister and had recently been baptized, so I wasn’t trying to get down with this girl at this point. Well I hear a door shut and my third friend (let’s call him Jaden) shows up after having gotten down with his gal at her place. Now I say this because if you’re heavily religious then you believe that the Holy Spirit was probably not in the house at all on this particular evening, but if you aren’t religious then disregard this paragraph.
We end up sending the girls home and it’s just us boys enjoying our senior summer playing CoD Zombies, which I wasn’t really into, but I enjoyed watching my friends play. Well 2:30am starts to roll around and my friend Jake asks if we want to play hide and seek in the dark, but with two caveats: 1) We play the game while the CoD Zombies theme song plays throughout the house and 2) no hiding in the basement because it’s pitch black. Looking back to this night the moon was fairly bright, so your eyes would adjust quickly to the nighttime if you were hiding and seeking upstairs but not at all downstairs. Jake, Sam, and I were into scary shit, but Jaden wasn’t the biggest fan of it. Regardless, we all decided to play the game to this creepy music and Jake was the first one as seeker. 
Sam, Jaden, and I immediately agree to be bastards and hide in the basement because we knew it’d take Jake forever to find us, so we hide in one of the bedrooms that was filled with a bunch of wooden chairs. About 10 minutes into him searching we hear him come downstairs and he begins talking to someone(s) on the basement stairs. We then hear him yell something to these people and then he enters the room we’re hiding in. He starts moving loads of these chairs and finds us and we start giggling like girls because we knew we broke the rules. We ask him who he was talking to and he says, “Dude I thought I was talking to Sam and Jaden but all of you guys were here so I have no clue who the silhouettes were on the stairs that were just looking at me and then ran away.” 
Jake loved scary shit so we shrugged it off like it was typical Jake trying to make a situation scary/creepy at night.
Anyway, 15/20 minutes is a long time for one round of hide and seek, so we decide to just chill in the living room on the main floor while the CoD Zombie music is playing dimly in the background. After a few minutes of us hanging out I say, “We should watch a real exorcism video. I bet I can find one online.” So I bust out my Mac and start searching for a video on obscure websites and finally find a vid. Jake was all for this, but Jaden and Sam were hesitant understandably so. But I’m me, and idgaf, so I turn it on. Interestingly enough, this was shortly after 3am and was during “The Witching Hour” which I didn’t think about until after the fact. So Jake and I are watching this priest just douse this random woman in Holy Water while the priest is chanting Hebrew at her. The girl is strapped to a table and her body is convulsing like the chick from the Ring. I remember watching this video and getting cold chills immediately, but I was mesmerized because I had never seen anything so raw and real of this nature. I couldn’t look away. Sam and Jaden tell me to turn it off and even Jake looks hesitant..
This is where things go south real quick.
About 20 seconds into this video, I start hearing a knocking noise (damn I’m getting cold chills simply typing this). This knocking noise was coming from the master bedroom directly above us in the living room and it continually gets louder.. and louder.. and louder.. and suddenly it sounds like 4 or 5 people are running and slamming violently into the walls in the room above us. I look at Jake’s face because he was sitting next to me and I can barely make out a look of horror on his face because again the lights were turned off everywhere in the house. Then I hear the chandelier in the foyer quake, and at this point I’m on high alert thinking, “Oh shit.” 
Despite Jake fooling around this night, he was a relatively goody goody and I had never heard him say the F word, but he immediately screams, “Turn it the F**k off!!!”
I slam my laptop shut and all four of us run directly to the backdoors, which was 10 feet away from us. 
As we’re running we here a loud THUD THUD THUD as if someone is punching the basement crawling from underneath us. It sounded like someone, or something, was trying to just tear through the floor beneath our feet. 
We make it outside during this time and everything in the house goes silent. No more running from upstairs, no more chandeliers swinging, and no more punching ceiling noises from the basement, it’s just us in the middle of the open nightly sky torn between trying to look away from the house and towards the mountains, but simultaneously checking to see if something was going to run out of the house. The house was dead quiet as if nothing ever happened and we were all gazing into the house from the backyard.
We were probably out in the backyard for two minutes in complete silence. I had noticed that Jaden was messaging someone frantically when we were outside and he looks at me and says.. “Michelle told me she was in the house with the her drill team friends like 10 minutes ago, but told me she was only kidding.. so what in the hell made those noises?!”

*back story: Everyone in the small town knew my grandparents were away, so it was common for my friends to just pop in the house whenever, especially the drill team gals because they were some of our close friends*

Right after he says this, I look at the other guys and all three of them are shedding man tears. All three of them were shook to their core about what had happened. During that 45 second window of pure chaos, we each felt a sense of dread and hopelessness sweep over us. It was 1000% a bad spirit (or a few) that had just been in that house. 
“Well I have this house for another 6 weeks and at some point I’m going to have to go back in there and sleep in there, so we have to go back in and see what happened.”
Understandably, they were strongly against this idea, but I felt spiritually strong because of my recent baptism, so I led the way while we single filedly walked in the house while each of their hands was grappling the person’s shirt in front of them. 
“We should go to the basement first because it’s the scariest and most obvious place where the banging noises were coming from,” I say. 
We slowly creep down the basement steps and I flip on the lights and see that the living room and kitchen were destroyed. The ceiling fan was laying on the ground and at initial glance had looked like it was ripped straight off the ceiling. There were broken shards of glass and wood chips from the chaos scattered about the room. Now I’m thinking, “How in the hell am I going to explain this to my family?”
Then we decide to search the rest of the house. The only other inexplicable thing was that the master bedroom’s closet light was turned on, which we didn’t ever turn on. 
That same night I decided to go to bed in my room while the guys slept downstairs (because I was on this Spiritual high and felt safe). But my friends each felt like they had uninvited the Spirit from their sexual endeavors earlier that night, so they all slept in the living room downstairs. Jake woke up the next morning and had a nightmare about a little girl standing in the living room watching them sleep, but Jake loves scary things so we never really knew whether he was being truthful about that dream or not. He’s an extremely honest person, but he loves overhyping these type of things, so I never knew what to make of that dream of his.
Fast forward to that weekend, my grandparents came over after my grandpa’s radiation treatment because I told them what happened. They’re somewhat religious, but not church fanatics, so they weren’t sure what to believe at first, but they knew I wasn’t a liar and so they took my story as truth. 
I walked downstairs to the basement with my grandparents and my grandpa bent to a knee to look at the ceiling fan’s wiring and he said, “This was cut perfectly across, someone did this intentionally. This didn’t fall out of the ceiling.” 
Since that day, it only furthered my testimony of a God and of an evil. As of 2016 I’ve started to have weekly reoccurring variations of a dream where I’m in that house with a dark presence. I honestly might go to therapy after talking to my wife about it as it seems to have caused lingering PTSD in some type of form for me. I’ll be grateful for that night because it caused for one hell of a story and an everlasting best friendship with those three guys. Thoughts?

Most come and go within a short period of time, will speak but not hold conversation with me, etc. Some have stayed for long periods of time and interacted with me. Some have been overwhelmingly positive, some overwhelmingly negative (as far as convincing me to injure and at times nearly kill myself), and more often, simply neutral entities that I just happen to come into contact with. Some can physically touch me, some can speak out loud (as if another person in the room), though most are closer to telepathic. Sometimes it's paralyzingly terrifying. Sometimes it life-changing-ly positive. Usually, again, just a neutral, interesting experience. When entities come, I welcome them, I stop what I'm doing, and I give them space to say or do whatever they need to communicate.

Anyways:

Today I encountered a new entity. I hopped in bed and immediately felt somebody patting/caressing my head. I thought, ""oh, this is nice."" Then she threw something at me- it was hard and hit me straight on the throat. At that moment, I said out loud, ""I would love to get to know you, and you are welcome here, but I need you to be nice to me."" Everything following that was positive. 

She was shy, but did tell me some things about herself. She said her name is Tagile. Later I did some research and it seems this is a Telugu word (language of Southern India) meaning ""touching."" Other translations include ""erosive"" and ""infectious"" (that last one concerned me a bit). 

She was responsive to me and demonstrated that she is capable of both telepathy and external speaking. She had a sense of humor. She sang to me beautifully. She is capable of physically touching me (my head, throwing that thing at me). To be able to speak externally and physically touch me is rare in my experience. 

Something unusual: typically when I hear disembodied ""voices""/entities, whether it's external, internal, or telepathic, I find I instantly know everything about them: what they look like, their age, sex, where they're from, their history... etc. None of this is true to Tagile. I have no idea what she looks like, how old she is, none of it. 

I do strongly suspect she is from the Telugu-speaking region of Southern India. I believe she used to be a living human and this is her spirit. And she is here to help me. 

I have been going through a *significantly* difficult and confusing time in my life. I think she, her altruistic self, sensed this in the universe and came to find me. Soon into our interaction (which lasted approximately 3-4 hours) it became very clear to me that she was showing me mindfulness, how to stay in the absolute present moment, and to trust myself and my experiences. She only exists in the absolute present moment. 

Like I said, I have experienced *many* entities who have come and gone over a short period of time, but I sincerely hope Talige is one who sticks around.

So I'd like to start from my earliest experience,

When I was like 11 years old, I used to sleep with my grandmother, one night I was really tired I slipped into bed from around 11:45 pm to 12 am. At that time I generally used to sleep on my back but I was not able to sleep that night. So there is a small lane between our house and our neighbour also our they have their tube lights on all night. The neighbour's lights started to flicker, but I didn't pay a lot of attention but then flicker timing got longer suddenly the I  stopped seeing the light there was something was wrong with the darkness, it darker than dark, I was going to chalk it up to my imagination I saw the floor I could see the neighbour's lights reflection, I looked up and saw blood-red eyes. I saw an entity at least  9 to 10 feet tall with that entity head touching the ceiling with wearing a hat, the hat man slowly drifted in front of my legs. Hat man and I had the most intense staring competition I was scared that if I  closed my eyes something bad would happen, I tried to stare into its eyes or eye socket or blood holes or whatever, my eyes started watering,  I could not hold on my eyes open. I lost my eyes blinked within the time the hat man was within a few inches of my face. This was not the worst, but this was I was unable to move at all I was not able to shout wanted to shout. Something ticked in me my hand could find the light switch and suddenly shout the entity disappeared. As I live with my family all of my family members came to the room to ask what happened. I  told my mum what happened but she didn't believe what had happened. She said you've been sleeping for quite some time at least just more than 3  hours I looked up the time saw it was around 3:30 AM. I could not understand how could this be possible I just want to sleep. How could 3  hours have passed, I was not able to understand. This was something I  could easily chalk up to sleep paralysis. This left me with nightmares and for days I would not be able to sleep. Even now that I write this story I still have chills down my spine.

They live in a different state and will only be using the house when they come visit us or we have other family visiting. 

The week before Thanksgiving, which would be the first time more than just my in laws would be at this new house I had something kind of strange happen to me. 

I had an appointment with my therapist for noon, my husband was home sick that day with a really horrible sinus infection so...I decided to walk down to my in laws house and take my video call there. 

I had my session and wasn't paying attention to anything other than my therapist and my coffee. After my session ended I needed to go to the bathroom. 

I walk up the stairs to the bathroom, sit down and scroll reddit. And I hear it. A thunk thunk. I disregard it and keep scrolling and reading. Then i hear it again, coming from above me, in the attic. 

I decided to take a video so I could capture the noise and send it to my husband. I'm thinking ""great....3 days before people come to the house and we have some kind of critter living in their attic"". 

The video captured the thunks as well as what sounds like scampering. 

I come back to my house, tell my husband to check his messages and ask him to come with me to check the attic. 

We grab a flashlight and head back to the house. I pull down the steps to the attic and put my phone on video with the flash on. I'm hoping a raccoon doesn't come and attack me. I never went into the attic but I was at the top step looking everywhere. There was nothing. Their attic is totally empty. 

My husband assures me it's probably just a fat squirrel on the roof. We forget about it. He's never been one for ghost stories or paranormal anything. A bit of a skeptic.

Until....last night. My husband had a therapy session (yay for taking care of your mental health) and decided to go to his parents house to have some privacy. He gets home and after we put our kiddo to be he tells me what happened. 

In his words:

As I walked to their house, it was dark, I fumbled with the key to get in. I pushed the door open. Turned on some lights. Locked the door behind me. And as I was about to begin walking up the stairs I hear what sounded like foot steps going up the stairs above my head. Soft. Slow. It sounded like a person.

I decided to check. Nothing was anywhere. Nothing was out of place. 

I thought ""Oh well"". I got through my session and decided to turn off the lights at the bottom of the stairs and I heard what sounded like 3 distinct thunks. Like car doors closing. But there were no cars around. So I stayed and listened. I heard a shuffling sound. Decided to get the fuck out and got home. 

I had a lot on my mind so I didn't really think much of it. Until right before bed. I listened to the video again and it was that same strange sound. I don't believe in ghosts or the paranormal, but this just didn't seem to make sense.


So...our question is: what do you think is happening here? These incidents happened when we were by ourselves. Weeks apart. When family was staying over, no one reported anything unusual at all.

My buddy was driving, as I was reaching towards the ground, trying to grab my phone that I had dropped. He suddenly said “this old lady next to us keeps pointing at me… I think she wants me to pull over”. I, always paranoid, said “fuck that dude keep driving”. But he pulled over. A black Escalade with plates from Alaska pulled in front of us. Out hopped a woman, no younger than 60, that said “I’m glad I got to you boys when I did, your tires are smoking!”

It’s important to note we were towing his Camry with the Uhaul we were in. 

Side note… What happened in Zanesville, was we got stuck in the parking lot, couldn’t back up, so had to re-hitch his car. We realized later he left the emergency brake on.

Anyways, after she said this we looked at each other completely puzzled, and immediately at the tires. They were absolutely smoking, looking like they had bullet holes in them. 

This is where it gets strange. Not even a few seconds after we kneeled down to inspect the tires, she was gone. No goodbye, no sound of a car pulling off… gone.

The whole interaction from her getting out of the car, to her vanishing couldn’t have been more than 15 seconds.

I didn’t have a doubt in my mind she vanished, and my friend looked at me pale as a ghost, confirming exactly what I was thinking.

I don’t know for sure what would have happened if we didn’t stop. I don’t know if the car would have caught fire, or anything else. 

But I do know she was an angel to us real or not.

I had it all the way up until 6th grade and somewhere around the 5th time moving it disappeared. 

Well now I'm 19 and just a year ago I remember how much I loved that bunny and went online and found it and bought a brand new one. I received it way earlier than expected, the doll was brand new, had the tag and everything. I did remove the tag because it's a sentimental item not something I plan on reselling. 

I've had the bunny sitting up on the shelf, perfect condition, not anything touching it. When I moved again the doll went in a suit case so avoid it getting ruined. Then immediately back on my shelf where nothing would touch it. In my bedroom too where no animals could get to it. 

Today... while hiding presents away in my closet so my cats wouldn't ruin them, I had to move the bunny to make room for presents. I put the bunny on my bed. My boyfriend told me to sit in the bedroom while he brought gifts in from the car, so I sat on the bed analyzing the bunny...

I feel such a strong energy coming from this bunny, it makes me want to cry, I feel really happy and sick to my stomach at the same time. The bunny is covered in rips and tears, the back of the bunny was completely torn apart... like my original one... the bowtie around it's neck is ripped and frayed, and it seems a little dirty. I live with just my boyfriend, I haven't touched and I know he doesn't care about it. It was in PERCECT BRAND NEW condition I'm almost terrified at the state its in... 

I had a pretty bad past, full of abuse, neglect, my parents fought alot, I get flash backs of glass shattering and my mom screaming, my father was an drunk abusive man. I think now I'm older I suffered through some kind of disorder I've grown to handle better because I always felt touched, spiritually, seeing things I wasn't suppose to, hearing demons, specifically scarred when I told my mom Jesus came to me in my sleep, I described him as something not like Jesus as all with the words ""Go to sleep so I can take you away and bring you to heaven"" but the scenario seemed sinister.

It’s nothing crazy but would like to hear someones opinion on this.


I play a game with my dog where I hide a toy and he tries to find it. Most of the time he finds it very quickly no matter how hard I try to hide it. 

This time I hid it upstairs in a fairly easy spot. I was sure he would find it right away. He went to look for it but after like 5 minutes he came back with nothing.

Confused, I went to show him where I hid it, but the toy wasn’t there anymore. That weirded me out so much that I walked back downstairs. My dog, weirdly, didn’t follow me. Instead he went behind the corner for a while and came back WITH THE TOY. 

If you ask me, theres basically no way he moved the toy and then came back downstairs with nothing. Everytime he finds it, he immediately comes to show it to me. Why would he find the toy, go to a dark room, put it there and then come downstairs with nothing? He’s never hidden anything but bones so that’s not the case here. 

Also, he was very excited when he came back from around the corner with the toy, like he had just found it. Not like he had taken it from where he last put it. 

Might be unrelated, but at the same time this was happening my mother told me the power went out in the house. 

My imagination is telling me that someone/something took the toy when he was looking for it the first time. And then gave it to him when I went back downstairs confused.

What do you think about this? Normally I rationalize every weird thing that happens so that I don’t think about it anymore.

Let me first say that while I do believe in supernatural/paranormal phenomena, I am still the sort to look for logical explanations to things. I do believe that whatever gives humans that “spark of life” remains after the body gives out. I also believe in the possibility of elemental “spirits”, spirits far older than humanity that are connected to the earth itself. 

We were at my in-laws house (Charlotte, NC, area, US) this past Saturday, and while I sat at the dining room table chatting with MiL, in my periphery on the left side I saw and felt something whiz by me. It was at least 12” in length, maybe longer, with spindly arms and legs and a thin body. I only saw four appendages - two “arms” and two “legs”. There were no wings that I could see, and while I wouldn’t really say it was anthropomorphic, the arms and legs were positioned in a way I’d imagine them in someone were to lift a person in a harness and “fly” them - hanging to the front and bent back and knees/elbows. 

This thing had a head that was elongated and slightly rounded, oval shaped so it was longer than it was wide, but I didn’t see any facial features. The best thing I can compare it to would be a giant stick bug with only 4 legs. 

I’m 100% certain that it was NOT an insect. There’s no way something that large would be in the house and no one saw it sooner. Plus, my MiL has two cats that are prolific bug catchers. 

Has anyone ever encountered something like this? When I saw it, the word “Fairy” immediately came to my mind, though I’ve never been one to believe in “fairies”.  I’m just baffled as to what it might have been. I know I didn’t imagine it, it was definitely there and I heard a soft whoosh as it passed.

No idea exactly where we were, but I remember saying to my bandmates as we pulled into the lot that “this place gives me a Twilight Zone vibe.” It just had an eerie sort of presence to it, and I like that kind of shit so it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.

So I don’t even know what the other two guys were up to. They may have just stayed in the car, but what I do know is that me and the bass player had to go inside and piss.

This is just your normal setup of a parking lot out in front of a rest stop off of a highway. I don’t smoke anymore, but back then I did. Me and the bassist decide to smoke a cigarette first before going inside to pee. He offers me one of his cigs and ensues to call up his girlfriend to update her on how the trip is going.

So I’m just standing there smoking and chilling, and he’s standing next to me smoking and on the phone. We are both out in front of the entrance to the rest stop and we are both facing outwards towards the parking lot with our backs to the entrance of the building.

Suddenly, while still on the phone, the bassist starts casually walking back out towards the van in the parking lot. I see him walk away and his voice grows more distant. I don’t recall exactly how far away we parked. But there’s only one lot and I remember just seeing him walk into the distance in front of me, still on the phone with his girlfriend. This confused me, as I thought he had to go inside to piss. But I didn’t give a shit, and I was finishing my cigarette as this moment unfolded. So I just shrugged and put out my cigarette and immediately turned around to head inside the rest stop building.

As soon as I get inside, it’s completely empty, but you have to walk straight ahead down this hallway to get to the bathroom. I remember there was some sort of Route 66 clock that had a spiral shape or something directly above as you enter this hallway. It just overall...had a Twilight Zone sort of vibe to it. I don’t know how else to explain this experience.

So I’m walking down the hall and I get into the bathroom...and I hear someone in the stall who is talking on the phone. His voice sounds EXACTLY like my bassist. No one else is in the bathroom. I can’t see who is in there, but I’m standing at the urinal pissing and laughing about how weird it is that this guy sounds so similar to my bandmate. But I know for a fact that it cannot be him, as it would be physically impossible for him to have gotten into the bathroom before me when I literally JUST saw him head out towards the car in the parking lot about 20-30 seconds earlier at most. I even said to myself, “now THAT would be ridiculous if it was somehow him”...but even as I said this to myself, I knew for a fact that it wasn’t him...

...Except that it was. Sure enough, a moment later, the stall door opens and out comes the bassist, still on the phone with his girlfriend. I’m finishing pissing so he is behind me washing his hands. I turn around and I see him still on the phone and he’s now walking out of the bathroom. I don’t even think that he noticed me in there with him. But at this moment I am absolutely stunned. And I’m left there in the bathroom by myself wondering wtf just happened. I ended up telling him and everyone about this when I got back to the van, and he also explained that he went through a different series of strange events but I can’t remember the details of his side of the story anymore.

All I know is that it was simply physically impossible that he could have been in that bathroom before me when I literally saw him walk out into the distance towards the van and I immediately headed inside to the bathroom.

Sorry if this was overly long. But I wanted to be as succinct as possible about how it went down. ",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936680,public,new,self,Bandmate two places at once,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rma3xx/bandmate_two_places_at_once/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ll give a little context and a few examples of paranormal things that happened, but I’ll eventually break down to a dot point list of different things that have happened over a long period of time. Here we go. 


Around 5 years ago my good friend J’s parents went to spend 12 weeks in Europe travelling and visiting family. He had a free house and I was 23 at the time so naturally I moved in for 11.5 weeks. At this stage I had already heard of weird things going on but he had never attributed these things to a ghost or spirit or anything of the kind until I stayed there with him. 

There was a small cabinet table for a small television in the kitchen who’s left door would frequently be left open. We closed it almost everyday. The door would require a slight amount of force to open from the t shaped pin that clipped the door shut. On one occasion my friend and I entered the kitchen and the television was on. No one had used it in weeks. He promptly turned it off and turned towards me. As he turned towards me it turned straight back on. He leaned down and turned it off again and then unplugged it from the wall. It didn’t turn back on. 

On many occasions throughout the 12 weeks but mainly in the first couple weeks, when we had more visitors over, the main tv in the lounge room would start to raise the volume up to maximum while we scrambled for the remote to stop the deafening blasting of system of a down or video games. It would randomly mute and unmute. It would change to a different hdmi while we would be playing games. No one was messing with the remote or anything. We attributed it to the fact it was a smart tv and the voice activation commands must have been doing it. We figured out weeks later there was no microphone in the model of tv he had and no voice commands at all. 

At one stage during the 12 weeks J and I got a common cold. He was a little bit of a clean freak and didn’t like me leaving tissues around so instead of getting up every 5 minutes to throw away tissues we created a pile on a clean tissue and disposed of them every hour or so. And one stage j asks me , “ is that your tissue?” Pointing over to the dining room table that we had Not used at all. I said of course not and he went to investigate. It was a scrunched up tissue put in the middle of the dining room , under the table, unused. 

We arrive at the dot point section. Multiple times throughout my stay there toilets would flush while no body was using them. Items would go missing. Strange sounds of walking and clapping. Candles outside seemingly lit by nobody. Strange smells of rotten eggs blown in j’s face. I watched him physically repulse backwards. J has heard his name whispered to him while nobody was around. 


There are so many more things that have happened in this house but not directly to me or around me and as per the rules I can’t write about those but more than happy to talk about them in the comments. Mods correct me if I’m wrong. We have never believed this spirit to be malevolent and never felt in danger or scared. Just all weird and unexplained or otherwise paranormal activity. At this stage I’ll leave it here because it’s destroying my phone and its becoming too long.

I had been up all night taking care of her, and I had been doing laundry and other chores all morning so I was pretty tired myself. My husband ran to the store to get some groceries, so I decided to take a nap while Natalia was sleeping. 

I grabbed the baby monitor and went to lay down in our bedroom across the hall. I always make sure I grab the baby monitor when I’m going to lay down, since I have two sleeping disorders and I sleep hard, so I don’t always hear her cries when she needs something. Anyways, I decided to read a little bit before napping. All of a sudden I hear a bunch of static coming from the baby monitor. I ignored it and continued reading, figuring as long as my daughter wasn’t crying I could ignore the noise. 

“Amanda, Amanda.” I heard a kids voice quietly say over the baby monitor. I froze… did I really just hear a child call me over the baby monitor? I instantly felt creeped out, and like something or someone was watching me. Scared, I ignored the voice. I heard static again, and then the same voice say, “come here.”

Still very creeped out, I went across the hall to my baby’s room, and saw my sweet girl laying in her bassinet quietly looking at me walk through the door, almost like she was waiting for me to come and get her. Quickly I grabbed my daughter, and left the room. 

I’m not sure if she was communicating to me through the baby monitor somehow? As I mentioned earlier I do have to sleep disorder so I’m not always very good with hearing her cries when I’m sleeping so I’m not sure if this was a way of her signaling to me that she needed some thing before I fell asleep? Or if there is something in her room that was communicating to me? I’ve never felt any malevolent spirits in our home, but I did feel on edge after that experience a couple of days ago.

We made contact with multiple people we asked them questions and they responded, i had never talked to ghosts before so this was really special for me. There were a lot of voices.

Like I’ve never experienced this sort of smell before - very sweet and pungent odour. Assuming that it must be some sort of dead animal, I went back to sleep but couldn’t as the smell worsened which made me sick to my stomach. Now, I admit I sleep on the floor since I suffer postural issues which makes me closer to the 2 vents in my room. 

Recently, my schedule got mixed and I’ve been waking early to catch up with homework between 2-5 in the morning. And I’m not the type to hallucinate about anything since I don’t have any medical history or records telling me otherwise. As for my bedding it is where it used to be, right next to the vent since it makes me warm especially on cold occasions. 

But as I’m alert during the early morning hours, I find out that I’m not the only one awake. I literally hear to what sounds like a guy talking to himself by saying a couple random things from somewhere downstairs. Now my family at this time is normally asleep and I only live with 3 ppl so there’s no reason to hear a human voice from downstairs. Other days, if I don’t hear the guy, I hear music to what it reminds me as a ringtone in the form of instrumental music. Rattling sounds also occur but they’re quite normal as the air in my vent is quite active. But once the air stops, I hear either the voice or the music once after every 2/3 hours.

Less than 10 minutes ago, I was on my way home from my friends. About 10 minutes into my drive I noticed I was being followed. Literally all the way home, more than 10 miles from the time I noticed by this dark cloud thing. I was on the freeway going about 60 mph when I noticed it. 

I was the only car on the road, and out of the corner of my eye in the right hand lane next to me was this thing. A cloud is the best way I can describe it.. it was very dark and formless, kind of translucent.. I could barely see through it but it was transparent enough for me to not 100% be sure it was there. 

It really freaked me out so I called my wife, and then I decided to change lanes into it to see if it would disappear, and it did. I thought so anyway. 

About 30 seconds after i lost sight of it, it instantaneously reappeared right outside my driver window. 

It was a little bit taller than my car and was about 3x as long. 

When I took the exit to get home, it disappeared again and I thought I lost it. Less than a minute layer it reappeared outside my passenger side. 

It was almost as if it would just float over my car from one side to the other while keeping pace with me the entire time until I turned I nto my driveway, where it disappeared again...

My  driveway is about a half mile long, shared with 5 other houses. The house right before mine has a dog that ALWAYS runs up and jumps on the chainlink fence and barks like clock work, but as I drove by it ran toward the fence and stopped dead in its tracks about 15 ft from the fence and didn't make a sound... THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. Seriously this dog never misses a chance to yell at the neighbors..

My wife was waiting in the front yard for me when I pulled up but because of the darkness of the driveway and lack of lights she said she couldn't see anything....

I woke up having a view of myself in 3rd person and first person at the same time. I was laying down, paralyzed and levitating about 4 feet off my bed with my blanket still dropped over me. I noticed a massive tarantula like spider that was big enough to cover my entire chest sitting on top of me. I was absolutely petrified. I remember the entity trying to give me a very strong sense of superiority, like it was stronger than me and that it was in control of the situation. After ten seconds of this it began speaking to me telepathically, in a VERY DEEP voice it said “my name is” it then said an extremely bizarre sounding name from a language I’ve never heard before and I don’t think I could spell it if I tried. It felt like whatever it was, was trying to possess me because like I said, it gave a very strong feeling that was superior than me and in charge of my life now, it was introducing itself. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up. 
After this I had another experience where I had just woken up and wasn’t paralyzed this time. The entity was on my roof at the other side of the room. This time it didn’t look like a solid being, it looked like it was made out of pure energy. When it noticed that I could see, it started scurrying towards me very aggressively and before it got to me it disappeared. This all happened within like 10 seconds. 

This one happened around the same time. I had woken up on my bed, I had the same povs and I was paralyzed again but this time I wasn’t levitating. I suddenly felt an invisible force grab onto my left leg. It very slowly started dragging me off my bed and as I was being dragged my body was violently flopping around like rag doll, I had no control over this. I realized what was happening and I tried to call for Jesus but as I was saying je- something held my lips. I literally couldn’t say his name and I got the feeling that I was unworthy to speak it because the way I was living. I remember feeling an IMENSE feeling of dread and hopelessness, he wouldn’t help me. this one felt like it was a warning to change my ways before it was too late. it was the last thing i remember before waking up.

“sleep paralysis” but I feel entity’s can attack us in our dream state and cause what’s know as sleep paralysis.

Maybe 4th time telling anyone this story(?), and the first time sharing it anywhere online. 

Let me preface by saying that when this happened to me, I (33M) was barely sixteen years old, and was as much of a skeptic or a believer as any kid at that age could be. 

I'd had other 'unexplained' incidents before this, but this is the one that stayed with me most of all. 

So, I went to bed in my very boring, very normal mid-2000s bedroom, played a little Nintendo DS (later than I should've on a school night, I'll admit), then slept for maybe an hour or two (a little after 1AM) before waking up in DESPERATE need to take a piss. 

I roll outta bed, not bothering to grab my glasses--my first mistake, as someone who's literally legally blind without 'em--and take the muscle-memory four steps, diagonally, across my tile-y bedroom floor. 

I am a VERY tactile person due to my visual impairment, and I had my whole house, not only my ROOM, memorized (for safety) to a T. 

I reached for my doorknob, and I get... nothing. 

Okay, maybe I'm not as awake as I thought. Never happens to me, though--I wake up if one of my parents so much as breathes wrong across the damn house, but okay. I'm groggy? I reach to the left, since I must've angled my walk wrong.

Nothing. 

I try right. 

Nothing.

Did I not walk far enough? I feel really awake now. 

I take another step, regretting the no-glasses choice. I can barely make out shapes in the daytime, and darkness is a blanket over my eyes. I can't see my door, my bed, my own hands in front of me.

I can't see. 

Where is my door?

I take another step. Two. Three. Four. 

I flail my arms forward, silently pleading, please, my door, and I swear I can see the nightlight in the hallway that's there so I won't eat carpet on my way to the toilet--thanks mom--but no matter where I reach, how far I go, I can't get close enough. 

My memory gets hazy here, after a maybe two straight minutes of aimless walking towards the hazy outline of light around a door, but my last thought from that 'between' space/time is knowing, and feeling that I was not 'At Home'. 

Then I'm in the hallway, and I sleep on the couch the rest of the night. Looking into my room felt like staring into an abyss.

Feeling presences and having auditory experiences.

Backstory: I've had encounters and seen things as a kid (towels moving, book being fanned through, crying women sitting on my bed at a hotel when there was no one there but my family, my mom felt and heard her too). That all quieted down through the teen years. In my early 20's to now mid 30's I've been having these weird sensations that the only way I seem to be able to explain is like someone is trying to. It's always when I'm asleep. I will wake up with my body from the nape of my neck to the tip of my toes feeling cold and tingly like my whole body fell asleep except for my head. I have to force myself to physically twitch and it all stops instantly. This happens a few times a year, maybe Max 5 in one year. The last 2 times there was... More.  I will refer to this cold tingly feeling as the sensation from here on out.

2 times ago when I got this sensation I felt like there was a lot of ""presences""  in my room, never had the feeling of anyone in my house before but this time it felt like more than just me and my husband in the room. I get the sensation, shake it off, turn around and go back to sleep.  I get the sensation again, I shake it off, think ""that's weird it's never happened twice in one night"", roll over and go back to sleep. Then it happened 3 times in a row, is shake it off, a second would pass and it's hit again. I had this feeling the the presences in my room were lined up at the foot of my bed waiting their turn.  That finally stopped, I rolled over and went back to sleep. I woke up with the sensation one more time, shook it off, and then felt like something was standing right next to me. I lightly opened my eyes and I could see a black outline of someone with a hat, straw hanging out of their mouth, overalls with one shoulder strap undone... Very farmer-esk. I've always lived in the suburbs usually just outside of a big city so while I've seen farmers I don't interact with them. So he's standing there looking down at me, turns around and walks out of the house which means out of the wall closest to my side of the bed which overlooks my driveway. When he left, , I felt every other presence leave with him. I woke up in the morning feeling like my muscles and chest were sore.

The last time this happened was a couple weeks ago. I was having a really rough night sleeping. Tossing and turning a lot so I was awake for all of it this time. All of a sudden it was silent like my ear popped and it was going to take a second for sound to come back but it never did. I have a box fan running all night, I couldn't even hear that anymore, it was like an absence of noise. Then it started sounding like there was a crowd off in the distance, actual voices not the white noise of the box fan. I get the sensation and as I'm building up the strength to twitch and shake it off I hear a man panting really close to me like he was sprinting from the crowd to me. I him yell (there's a pause and breath between each word like he was really exerting himself to say this) ""I. JUST. WANT. TO. SEE. MY. FAMILY!"" I shook the sensation off as he finished and sat up in bed as the regular sound of my room came rushing back to me. 

Feel like this is escalating and not sure if it is attempted possession, again that's the only way I can think of to explain the sensation, like something is trying to take over which is why my body gets cold and tingly, but they can't get my head so it doesn't fully take?  Has anyone else ever feel this type of sensation. I sleep on my stomach so I thought I was maybe pinching a nerve but with the last 2 times seeing and feeling something near and then hearing the man yell as he was getting closer...

Every weekend, I head home to relax and hang out with my parents. I have to pack a few things to bring home with me, (laptop and the like.) I get done packing these things and I leave my private room.

I turn around to close my door, and when it's shut, I hear loud footsteps from my room and then a loud bang, my door moves, as if it had been run into. I silently freak out, and open my door, there is nothing. None of my roommates are in my room. Nothing is there.

This won't be short by any means, but will try to keep it limited without writing a novel. So I'm sorry about that in advance 😂

I became pregnant with my son in 2006. I was 17 (18 when he was born) &amp; was due oct 20th. I kept waking up or seeing the clock at 10:23. It drove me nuts for the longest time. I went into labor on oct 20th, but had an emergency c section at 1am on 10/23/2006. My son was born. 
Some yrs later, I wanted to visit my gpas grave. Don't remember the time of year or what prompt me to go. But we went. And I found his headstone after a bit of searching. I seen he died on oct 23, 2000. 6 yrs before my son was born. Since then, whenever I seen 1023. I took it as a hello or sign from him. I seen it from time to time over the years but never thought too much of it.

Fast forward to late 2017. I had a doom/overwhelming feeling that something bad was going to happen. It was late October. Started seeing 1023. Son was injured. Figured it was that. (And the # was now a warning as I was seeing it too often and in different patterns (2103, 1230, etc.). But it wasn't. That feeling hung around. 
Totalled my 5 month old car Nov 30, 2017. Figured it was that. It wasn't. I had this feeling for the next month or so (and still seeing this number everywhere...) Until... My mom told me she had cancer. That feeling and number went away. Until mid April. And the number popped up again. Everywhere and on everything. I knew something bad was about to happen. Mid may, my mom was placed on hospice. And went into liver failure. I ended up taking care of her, her last months of her life; just days before she passed. 

Life went quiet. Until the following January of 2019.

Started 1023 here and there but seeing a new number too. 426; which is my birthday. 

I knew this now meant something else. But it wasn't good. I've made the connection at this point that birthday #s are how my family members connect to me to say hello or warn me something bad is about to occur. 426 was a warning from my mom.

May came around and my aunt mickey (mom's sister) was diagnosed with breast cancer, weeks later my other aunt si (her sis in law) was also diagnosed with breast cancer. (My aunt mickey had radiation and is still here but must have an oxygen box on her as the treatment warped her lungs bad.) 426 died down again, until November 2019. And 426 picked back up. My uncle now had bladder cancer (aunt mickeys husband). Number 426 kept up, but it went crazy and showed up as 264, 4206, etc... And in February 2020, my uncle died from bladder cancer. He went from zero signs in October to his body being filled by the time he passed. I was flabbergasted. But 426, slowed down again... For a while. Until the summer of 2020 and it picked back up again. When my brother disclosed he was sick and sent me pics of him passing blood or coughing it up. But he refuses to get treatment and says ""when it's my time, it's my time."" That was the last bad notice with my numbers.

Until this past spring and summer... I kept seeing 426 again. It was driving me MAD by this point. Like what the hell could it be? Who is sick? Who is about to die? Couldn't put my thumb on it for months... Until this past October, when I finally got pregnant after 6 long ass years of ttc. My due date you ask? 6/24 (a variation of 426).

Apparently, the subject in the photo is supposed to be Ronnie's younger brother, or the ghost of, should we say. 
The only question I have and an answer I can't seem to find, is did Ronnie ever confirm the photo? If not, why did noone ever ask him or anyone that knew the boy to confirm if that was truly his younger brother.

I would see him frequently and funny how I was never scared of seeing him even though I was very scared of ghost as a kid and I knew it was a ghost

. Well anyway it would always look at the photos that I was in and look at me and look back but one day he was walking towards me, so I ran back to our other living room (yes we have two) and then later I was doing hw and I could see in that room our chandelier was swaying back and forth and I tried to reason it as my mom must have cleaned it but my mom wasn't even home.

 I've seen him couple times again and then it hit me that the blue man was my grandpa who died in 2001 and I was born in 2006 so thats why he was looking at me in photos because some photos I wasn't even born yet and others I was about 8 years old so maybe that's why he looking at them wondering who I was. Well last year my mom told me my brother who is 7 years older than me also seen him at the same age so I asked him and he said he was everywhere in the house in every room and that he would wave to him. 

We concluded that it was our grandpa. Idk why he was blue I just assumed it was because he was a marine for years. my dad and mom could smell cigarette smoke in our house and our grandpa was a smoker.

Additionally, he wrote another book called ""American Forrest Anomalies"" - which is both about sightings of the Paranormal and of ""Hidden Organizations"" in North American Forests.

So in my dream the front door was opening, and I bolted it, but the first time didn't work and the door opened again once I was in bed, so I had to get back up a second time.
Then back in my room I saw a shadow move from the front door to the spare room, and I felt watched. For some reason I just felt so not ok. 

So I don't know why, but I grabbed a Christmas candle to do an exorcism in the room, even though I know your beliefs (or lack thereof) could make it worse. But my logic was that a Christmas candle was better than nothing with my atheist ass since I believe in the spirit of Christmas in terms of love and kindness. So I get in the room and start to say ""in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost"" (because that's what you're supposed to do?) I got as far as ""son"" and felt like I was being suffocated, so I'm trying to scream it out and something threw me... then I woke up. My whole body was pins and needles and my muscles were sore. 

I've been feeling anxious in my apartment ever since I woke up, and turning my back to that area gives me goosebumps. I can't help but wonder if there's an entity that helped itself inside.

&amp;#x200B;

I had just woken up and there was a beautiful warm glow coming into my windows from the sun outside. I was fully awake and not lucid dreaming. I heard someone say ""Hello, (my name)"". It sounded almost like static and wasn't through my ears. It wasn't a fluid noise but it was fluent english. It felt telepathic. But it was like straight up radio static turned into a voice. Sounded almost male. It made me laugh, though, because I had been practicing lucid dreaming for years and thought maybe it was bleeding into my consciousness and was like ""welp, this is it, i've gone mad"".

I don't know if it was ghostly or alien-y, but it had a great feeling of warmth and humor to it.

I've always remained closed to any paranormal activity growing up. But as I've gotten older and the better I get with therapy, the more open I am to spiritual experiences and new things.

The other night I was working (I work from home) while everyone slept. I was using scissors. At one point I thought I misplaced my scissors, and I spent five to ten minutes looking for them. I was working in my bedroom, and my wife was sleeping (we have a large room that has a work area that I use), but at no time did my wife or anyone of children wake up. This was like at 2 or 3 am. 

After five or ten minutes of searching, I was completely dumbfounded. I accepted defeat and left the bedroom to grab another pair of scissors. They were kid scissors, but I was happy to have found them because I was almost finished with my work and ready to crawl into bed. When I returned to my bedroom the scissors that I had original lost were sitting on my table. Right where I was sure I'd left them.

I was confused, and I knew something wasn't right; I knew the scissors were not there a minute ago before I left the room. I didn't overthink it. In fact, I was happy they turned up. That was two nights ago.

This morning while we were getting the kids ready for school, my daughter told me that her boot liners were soaking wet from playing in the snow the day before. I pulled the liners out of her boots and went down to the basement and put them into the dryer. I went back upstairs. 

About ten minutes later, I went back down to the basement to grab the liners out of the dryer. The dryer was not running and the liners were cold. There is no doubt in my mind the dryer was running when I went back upstairs. Okay, no big deal, I thought. I started the dryer again, waited a few seconds to make sure there wasn't something wrong with it, and then I went back upstairs.

Ten minutes later I go back down to the basement to grab the boot liners out of the dryer. The fucking drying is off  and the boot liners are cold and wet. At this point my daughter is pissed at me and decided to throw on her sister's old boots. 

The dryer has been working fine all day.

This is more of a vent, I guess because I'm not that worried. I believe in a lot of wild shit, and I know something is messing with me. I'm pretty sure I've been dealing with this same thing my entire life off and on regardless of where I live.

She was given a new toy book for Christmas that plays music along to the pages when you turn them, and I keep it in the top of her toybox where it sits untouched. It's got new batteries, and has only been used for two days.

I went to make a phone call to my grandmother when they left, and about 5-ish minutes into the call, I heard the little book start to sing one of it's songs, and see the lights going off. It wasn't being touched, so I just ignored it, assuming it's a wiring issue or that something fell and bumped the box.

A few minutes after it stopped the first time though, it starts again, and this time starts going off as if it's buttons are being pushed randomly, which starts to pique my interest. I tried to get a video, but I was still on the phone, so my phone wouldn't let me record.

Eventually I hung up and heard nothing for another few minutes. But then, I heard it playing it's music again. I tried to take a video one last time, but I wasn't able to open my camera before the little song stopped. The weirdest part is, it stopped completely after my husband came home, and hasn't happened since. I usually don't think much of weird stuff like this, and am admittedly a huge skeptic, but I'll also admit to feeling like I was being trolled by something that new I was alone and couldn't catch it, lol.

It's just a weird feeling or weird emotion I wanna describe.

So whenever I see red lights or say red LEDs or red Neon lights or hear some bells jingle or listen to certain humming (female) sounds I feel restless. Some weird imagination (not a dream) runs through my mind which goes something like: I am lil baby in some swinging bed (I forgot the exact name) in a room where there are few other people. I don't see the face of any, just blurred out figures and someone among them is looking after me. The room is having dimming red lights and I hear those people speaking (crowd noise) but couldn't understand any. The room is the topmost floor of a not so tall building also my bed is near a window there's a big tree outside the window.

I get nostalgic thinking of all these but in reality these things never happened to me. My room was never like that. I never slept in swinging beds. There was never any red lights in my room and there is no tree outside my home.

Interestingly I get these imagination more frequently during Christmas time as I see more and more of red lights and I always have that unexplainable attachment to Christmas celebration even though I am not even a Christian.

I have a love hate relationship with this experience because I get restless and nostalgic unnecessarily but on the other hand I love whatever goes on in my imagination.

For more info check post 1 &amp; 2! 

Some background!
This is my 3rd encounter I had in my stay at the historic house built in 1901 that my family bought and stayed at!
Back in North Carolina we have had a lot of hurricane’s and tropical storms before! And this takes place during a awful tropical storm while eating dinner!

This one isn’t as long and is shorter then the others!

Story: me and my family were sitting at the dining table eating dinner.
The heavy rain and wind outside knocked out the power and we had to light candles! We sat eating our dinner with the house and table dimly lit. The table is in the middle of the dining room and the door to the hallway is across from it so you can see the stairs that lead upstairs from where you are sitting easily.
As we are eating my mom and me see out of the corner of our eyes a brod chested shadow man. This was a man for sure it’s chest was sharp and brod and he was very tall! But he looked elegant! He had his hand on the stairway rail and was walking down the stairs! I could see all these details in the few seconds we saw him, but one things for sure! He was pitch black, like as dark as a shadow! 
I looked at my mom and she looked at me and we both looked at each other her eyes almost asking me “ did u see that too “
We nodded and went back to eating.
We always joke and say maybe he was the guy who built the house! He looked like he would be!

Here is some background first!
To read about my homes history check my previous post!

I adopted a cat from the street at our historic home! He was disabled and had a super special meow that sounded like a “ mrow “ due to his head being run over when he was a kitten! this is key information needed for the story!


Story: 
It was close to Christmas and probably the 2-3rd year we lived there! And my disabled cat mister went missing! He was 8, and highly disabled so even though I was absolutely torn and depressed I knew he would eventually pass. 
not long after I started hearing his super special “ mrow “ under the house! It seemed to be coming from the crawl space and I could hear it from the vents.

I told my mom “ MOM! I think I hear mister under the house “ my mom shrugged me off to wishful thinking…
But then she started hearing it, and my sister did! It went on for days, always through the vents “ mrow “ “ mrow “ and more “ mrow “. It got to the point where my dad was bugged to look under the crawl space! We watched him go under and… NOTHING! No cat has been in or out or was even able to in the first place.
But we all heard it! After the day he checked, the mrows stop.

I never heard it again.


We all think it was my poor disabled cat saying goodbye. still it gives me the chills when ever I think about it. How the mrows just stopped and there was nothing! Not even cat fur.

I used to want to spend the night at their house that I found very cool. It was a rather big house and had lots of rooms. I was usually scared of some of the rooms because they were vast and also dark and scary, so I’d sleep in the same room as my grandparents. Well one night I had to use the bathroom so I got up to see a woman (late 20’s to early 30’s) standing in the doorway of the bathroom. She did not greet me nor did she say a word but nonetheless she felt familiar. As soon as I blinked she was gone. I told my grandmother but she didn’t believe me because I was just a kid. So years later I come around just wandering the house and I see a picture on a shelf of that same lady. Turns out she was my great grandmother. She passed at the birth of my mother so no one besides my grandma knew her.

To preface, I don't generally wake up during the night and when I do it is generally just to turn over in a half-asleep state. 

This time, however, was a completely different story. I was fast asleep when suddenly I jolted wide awake and heard the sound of a female voice saying my name. I spent a few moments collecting myself and looked around the room to find that nobody was there and rationalized that it must have been my mind playing tricks on me since I was in the ""between"" waking and sleep state. I glanced at the time, 5:01am EST, and went back to bed.

Upon waking this morning I naturally started to wonder a bit more about if other people have the same experience and what they take away from it. I read about everything from hypnagogia hallucinations to angel communication and everything in-between. The thing I read that intrigued me was the accounts of people having these experiences that end up being essentially tied to another person in a different place (ex: someone wakes up in the middle of the night and later find out that a relative passed away at the same time).

At this point, it is important to mention that my wife is currently out of town so I got a bit unsettled at the thought that maybe something bad had happened to her. I anxiously awaited her to text me back this morning and, to my relief, she eventually responded and let me know she was okay. I proceeded to tell her about my experience and she revealed to me that she woke up this morning at 3:00/3:01am MST (the exact same time as me) to go to the bathroom and had thought about me as she woke up.

This obviously could all be a big coincidence, but it seems to me that there may be something more to it whether it be telepathy or something else that I am unaware of.

Does anyone have an explanation for this?

It is now just over 100 years old and was a very active place is both Great Gars, Korea and Afghanistan.

So anyways, one night, I'm sitting up doing sentry in a large open area called a ""parade square"" - imagine what basically looks like an airplane hangar with doors large enough to pull large vehicles into. The parade square is circled with office doors and lights above them, but otherwise the rest of the lights are off as it was like 3am and my course is all asleep on cots.

I'm sitting there in a chair, tired af and questioning my life decisions - when suddenly almost directly in front of me about 25m or so away, a shape emerges through one of the closed office doors. The best way to describe it is, the head and shoulds of a person, but black, the further down the body though it became less visible until at the point of the legs there was nothing. This shape drifted out of a door towards me, then turned and proceeded across a few of the closed doors before essentially evaporating.

Now I immediately assumed I was hallucinating or that the light and being tired was playing tricks on me. However, I looked to the guy next to me also doing sentry and he blurted out ""did you see that?! ""  He recounted what he had seen, it was the same as me.

About 3 months later. Same circumstances. I saw the same thing again but from a different door. My partner that night also saw it. 

Theres a lot of cool stories about this building,  things I have no experience with. One is a tale of the first world War, a young mother came to convince her husband to not go. Somehow or another, she threw herself and her daughter down a flight of huge concrete stairs and died. No idea if there's any truth to this. My friends work in an office down in the basement, in this long very creepy hallway that's typically dark after hours. They swear they've been there late at night and heard the sound of a girl shreaking and crying. Who knows.

At first, I thought I was bipolar and went to get medical attention immediately. No matter what pill they gave me, the visions kept coming, and they grew in length. They were all fictitious scenarios, really rich content and plots, like ideas that could write full-length novels of angels living among humans, aliens, hypnotists, and more. I just assumed I was severely mentally ill like you probably think reading this right now. Years pass, and the visions get so debilitating that I can't even focus at work, or pay attention to a single word at a meeting. It gets so bad I couldn't watch TV for a year. My visions were not full-on hallucinations, just an understanding where I could imagine what people would look like. I felt like I was daydreaming non-stop and I couldn't stop no matter how hard I tried. It got much worse after I was in a coma (alcohol-induced). 

The stories were so rich - I started thinking of aliens or angels scanning realities and forecasting the future, or that we were all living in a simulation played by some advanced alien being called ""Player X"". I went absolutely insane and even left my husband because my visions made me think that he was evil and that there was a lover waiting for me that never came. Obviously, leaving my husband because of what I thought was a delusion was one of the lowest points of my life (But it ended up being the best decision of my life). 

Then, I started to hear voices. I thought it must be schizophrenia, and then even more stories: alien princes, a world of abandoned bots that appear human, serial killers that get power through spirits, sex goddesses, etc. etc. 

Now I hear voices all the time, but they completely stop when I have a conversation. The voices are now telling me how to excel at work, be type A, even how to improve my makeup (I know this sounds crazy). I did more in a month with these voices at work than I did in a year (granted I was going insane with daydreams beforehand). The voices tell me to stop seeing the doctor because it's expensive, it doesn't work, and now they'll help me become a kind and responsible person. It greatly improved all my friendships because it taught me to be honest, kind, patient, and responsible. 

Then it said it would make me divinely sober. I know I'm going to lose people here, but I drank an entire bottle of Absolut Vodka and I was totally sober. I thought maybe there was something wrong with the liquor? So I chugged 12 cans of white claw and I was perfectly fine. Then I got a hallucination that was so vivid, it filled my entire peripheral vision with the most beautiful colors. I saw it with the same intensity with my eyes open and closed. The voice told me to just close them for comfort. There was about like a 30-minute collection of beautiful imagery, (i.e. me being a twin and playing with blocks, then me as a 16 year old in front of a stone castle, planets, a commentary on the legal system). There was so much and I have so much more things to say than what I put here.

I recently moved back into my house after a divorce. I now live alone, which sucks by the way.  Shortly after moving back in I started noticing a strange low pitched knocking sound but I listened closer it sort of has a gulping sound. It will do it sometimes just one beat then maybe 2 beats and sometimes up to 4 or 5 then pause for 10,20,30 seconds or even minutes between intervals. I search and search for the source but to no avail. Let me say that I make a living repairing homes and know this house inside and out. I can only hear the sound when I get in bed at night and it only does it after I turn the lights out. If I get up and try to hear it anywhere outside of a couple of feet from my bed it disappears. It always also seems to come when I am most vulnerable. I have been trying to stay strong but not only did I lose my wife my girlfriend after for whom I absolutely adore has dumped me too. Last night I was particularly sad and the noise was off the hook.  Now here is the kicker. I also experience incredibly realistic night terrors. Have had them my whole life. I swear to God that I flow into another dimension because every time it happens I am in the same exact place as current reality. When I realize it’s happening, the fear is beyond comprehension. I try with all my might to wake up and when I do it scares the shit out of me because I’m exactly in the same place in bed where the night terror is. An intense one happened last night. In the dream I was in bed lying on my back and had just woke up. (Not really. I was still dreaming)I had my right arm straight out to my side and felt someone grab my hand, not hard but definitely could feel it. Then I could hear the gulping noise. I tried to squeeze the hand but as I did I could feel it pulling away. It scared the hell out of me. Then my dog must of jumped up on the bed because I woke up to her licking my face and whimpering. She’s a great pup. I feel she knew I was suffering and saved me.

I was closed up in an entertainment room in the basement with my dog as my parents had left the house at around 8pm to go out on a dinner date. My dog, Mia, settled into her bed on the floor and I started up my favorite game, MH3U and had it set at a fairly high volume. 

I was nearing the end of an intense fight in the game that I was playing when Mia and I heard the garage door upstairs and the sound of my dad’s footsteps moving along the floor above us. Mia jumped up, barking and scratching at the door with excitement because someone was home. She did not appear to be threatened or scared at all. I look over at my phone and approximately 30 minutes had passed. 


Now, I was in a bit of a predicament being unable to get off of the couch I was on because I was recovering from a recent ankle surgery. So, thinking my parents just happened to be back early, I texted my mom asking if she could come downstairs to get the dog so she would stop barking. She then texted me back saying that they just sat down at their table and she had no clue what I was talking about. 

I really had an “oh s***” moment and quickly got my dog to quiet down and called my mom and explained the footsteps. She told me to call the police and she would tell my dad and they dropped everything and promised to come back home asap. While I waited I decided not to call the police because I couldn’t get up to lock the door and I was worried that if someone was in the house I would give myself away by talking.

A bit of a back story for the layout! 
This was about almost 6 years ago, we lived in a historic house built in 1901. My parents had a obsession with old houses and vintage back then. Let’s say after all the stuff we encountered they had a change of heart. 
This was in North Carolina, the house is now having mold issues and we have since moved and we are trying to fix it up and sell it.
The original owner was a rich man who built this 2 story house for his teenage daughter on her 18th birthday. The garage was also 2 story &amp; later burnt down 2 times.
It ended up being turned into a B&amp;B right before we bought it! My grandmother who has since past says she actually stayed there once! 
We bought it after a few years of a older lady running the B&amp;B. 
So this house has had many people walk on its land, and stay there!

me and my mom &amp; half sister never liked the garage, it gave us bad vibes. 
but this story isn’t about the garage! 
Now that we have some layout of the houses history I will tell you the encounter i had.
A heads up! I never have seen anything like this before or since that house!

Story: 
I was in the shower, shaving. The shower is big and has glass walls, me and my dad shared it due to my sister having the one upstairs!
The room was very foggy because I had the shower on a bit hot. I happened to look up at the door while shaving, and I see in the fog a full black figure with its hand on the door. 
I said “ DAD! Get out of the bathroom “ thinking it was my step dad accidentally stepping in on me! again I scream “ DAD! GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM “ it’s still there! I scream it several times! for what seemed to be about a minute with it just staring at me! i screamed one more time! “ DAD, IM IN THE SHOWER! GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM!! “ then it vanished AND THE DOOR MOVED a bit as its hand disappeared!
Furious, I get up and put on a towel and rush upstairs to my mom, asking her where the heck my dad is. She said…. “ he’s been on a dog walk for 30 minutes “ 



I myself had always been a heavy skeptic due to my family being Christian and myself going to church a lot. So I had no reason to believe in so called “ paranormal “ until I stayed in that house. this is just one story out of 3 I’ve had myself. 

My mom is has always been a skeptic and every time I ask her about that house she avoids my question, not denying the stuff we endured…

That house always gave me bad vibes, I myself felt unwelcome and nervous. 
Since and before that house, I’ve never seen or encountered anything again. 


We now live in Alaska and still own the house, we are trying to selling it and renovating it at this moment. 

thoughts? idk how else to explain it.

I just graduated 6th grade at the time and my family visited my relatives at our old house. It was getting dark at that time since we just got back from a resort after celebrating my grandfather's birthday so I was tired from all the swimming. Now, our old house has 3 exit doors, one as the main door that leads to our living room which had a window that you could look through to see the fields that surround our house, another that leads to the said fields, and one that leads to the open garage that we shared with our neighbor. My older sister was talking to my favorite aunt through a phone call at the fields and I wanted to talk to my aunt. I don't know why I didn't just go through the door that led to the fields to go to my sister, I decided to use the main door to go to her instead since you can still go to the fields but will take longer. I walked through our living room towards the fields and I looked through the window of our living room as I was starting to jog towards my sister.

To my horror, I saw a lady wearing a very dark dress just sitting very still and straight with her hands on her lap on our couch that I just passed through a few seconds ago. I couldn't see the lady's face as it was covered by a veil or something. I don't know if she was covered in blood or her attire just had some red pattern or something. I was so scared of what I saw that my jog immediately turned to a run as I bolted towards my sister. As soon as my sister handed me the phone, I immediately told my aunt about what I saw. She didn't really believe me and just talked to me for a bit before ending the call. When my sister and I headed back to our house, I asked the rest of my family if anyone went to the living room after I went to my sister. I knew that it was impossible for them to have changed their outfit to a black dress with red pattern as everyone else was at the kitchen when I walked through the living room but still asked them anyway if any of them went there after I did. Of course everyone said that no one followed me to the living room. I told them about what I saw and they didn't really have much of a reaction. They just joked that maybe it was our neighbor who we've been having a feud with for a while now.

No one ever really experienced anything paranormal in that house, except if you count my sister's few sleep paralysis about a little girl wearing a white dress that always wanted to play with her but would scare her all the time when she was younger  (I later on had a dream about that girl when we moved to our new house, I have another story about her). I never had any encounters before or after that event. I still don't know if what I saw was real or not since maybe I was just imagining it since I was tired from all the swimming afterall but I sure did avoid the part of the couch that the lady was sitting on and wouldn't stay at the living room alone for the rest of our visit.

It's been about 3 hours since that happened. The pains eased up a bit so I think I'm good there. Just kinda freaked out at this point.

So I wanted to share if anyone else has experienced this.

3 years ago I started going to my now BFs house that had to my knowledge, 2 spirits in it. One was a little girl but she deserves her own story. This story is about the other, that I believed to be a residual haunting of a white cat. His family does have a cat named Nora but she is black and I would see this white cat while Nora was with me or in sight. 

Fast forward to now, his family has moved to a new house. Nothing happened for nearly half a year in the house but after some finals stress in collage I had started seeing the white cat again! But this time I’m seeing it in my own home as well. Although a lot more infrequently and way less clearly. It’s now more just a shape of a cat moving in the edge of my eye, and I can’t see color any more so I’m not sure if the 2 cats are related if I’m actually even seeing this one at all. 2 weeks ago I saw it clearer than ever before. I looked right at its outstretched paw like it was taking a stride forward, but it was gone in half a blink. White. 

The other incident involves Nora entering the cat dimension. I was up at 4 am and decided to go upstairs for food. Nora came upstairs with me. On coming back down I left the door open for her. Once she came back down I shut the door behind her. Definitely 100% shut and latched. She can’t open this door. Half hour later I see her little black paw reach under the door. What? I open the door, and there she is again! She came downstairs twice lmfao. Probably not related to my white cat but wanted to share

My landlord was a very mean-spirited woman named Kathy. She used to joke about there being spirits in the house due to the events that she experienced growing up in the house, I shrugged it off, her and I didn’t get along well whatsoever so anything she said pretty much went in one ear and out the other.

Further into my stay there I started feeling like I was being watched every night, and honestly after having not been in that house for over a month now, looking back I’m realizing just how strange the energy there was.

I’d hear footsteps during the night, knocking on the door during the day and sometimes even bangs on the wall. 

A week before I moved, I was going to bed one night and just as I do every single night, I put my jewelry in my little porcelain bowl on my nightstand with its pink rose handle on the lid. 
Upon waking the next morning, I go to put my jewelry on and my grandmother’s ruby ring is gone. I proceed to tear my house the fuck up looking for it, only to never find it. 

I have never experienced anything like this before. I’ve yelled out “Any spirits who may have taken my items I don’t appreciate it and thank you for returning it.

Upon going up to the same bowl just now, I found a child sized bracelet, vintage looking with the name “Mary”

This is all 100% true but it’s old news for me, I just thought you guys should hear this.. or read.

As a kid we had about 10 acres of woods in our back yard stretching across the neighborhood, it was a bit of a rural area though so it was rare for a neighboring house to actually be occupied, but between you and me I think folks were just scared of the rumors going around that this old Victorian house on our street was haunted, which it was but still that’s rude to judge her like that.

But anyways, when I was 4-8 when I’d go to play in the back yard, I would hear something that sounded like Native American tribal music.

I could hear drums, singing, chanting, and dancing a few yards into the woods. Sometimes I could hear fire crackling, and laughter here and there while they danced and sang, but oddly enough I could only ever hear this while the sun was still out. 

I remember feeling somewhat peaceful hearing the music so I didn’t think much of it at the time, and I’ve revisited the area I could have sworn I heard the music coming from about a million times and the only notable discoveries were an old worn slightly burnt childrens chicken costume?? Scattered animal bones as nature does, 
and an odd looking dip in the ground with flat, smooth stones that look like they came from a river placed around it, and that whole thing looks about 150 years old so we used to call it The witch’s well.

But back to the past, at the same time frame as I would hear the native music, by the time it was dark outside, I’m not entirely sure why to this day, but as soon as the sun would set I would REFUSE to set foot in our back yard let alone be anywhere near the woods. The same time the music would stop.
I would get just such an unexplainable awful vibe from it, and it was scary enough to give me nightmares about the woods growing up, but I never saw or experienced anything that would warrant that sort of reaction.

When I was about 16 I spent a lot of time in the woods, one day I was walking around exploring with my sisters and a friend. We were talking about creepy things we’d experienced on the property in the past, sort of joking about it all, then I shit you not the second I stepped just one step off our property line in the woods, I heard the most unexplainable shrieking I could ever describe. 
It was like a child, a full grown man, a crow, a vulture, a cow, a fox, and a deep tuba all made the loudest sound they could possibly make all at the same time, coming from all directions. The trees rattled with wind and crows flew from branches and I booked it across the woods back home because hell no. 
From there the paranormal activity within the house itself got worse and bad luck has plagued my life, but whatever rite.

I’ve told these stories separately several times over the years but it just occurred to me that they all might be connected somehow, and if these are in fact linked then there’s so much more paranormal stuff that happened on that property that would make so much sense, and when in doubt ask Reddit what happened.

So Reddit, I gotta know why I was hearing peaceful tribal music in my woods at day, and why my woods were guarded by some hell born monster at night. 

Did these spirits curse me, or did my actual house haunting have something more to do with our wayward Victorian age spirits from the house up the road? Which looking back explains the hatless top hat man a bit better, and that’s cute and all but what some old guy in an endless search for his hat dosent explain is.. the thing on all fours that would run down the halls at unnatural speeds for the way it sounded like it looked clawing at the doors… or why a spirit named Andrew has been following me around since 2015…",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936169,public,new,self,Native spirits in my back yard,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rkz3wz/native_spirits_in_my_back_yard/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I found the source of the noise and promptly ripped the mp3 homing station out from the wall outlet. I let out a *sigh* of relief as I let my hands scurry for my phone to check the time.

It was exactly 3:14 a.m., again.

This had happened twice now. My mp3 didn't have bluetooth or an alarm function. I never did figure out why it kept going off at that specific time. I always wondered if it was some demon or some paranormal thing. I was about 16, so that was the first explanation I could muster up before a seemingly logical electrical issue. At the witching hour, demonic activity is the last thing I want to dwell on, so I huddled in my blankets and fell back asleep. I left the homing station unplugged.

I awoke at my normal time a few hours later. I went to school, did my after school activities, had dinner and such. Before I knew it, I was tired and wanting to sleep. I thought about what I had been experiencing, and checked that my mp3 homing station was still unplugged. It was, so I closed my eyes and drifted off, only to wake up too early once more.

No music? Having been accustomed to the strange phenomenon, I was confused. I grabbed my phone to check the time.

Suddenly a sense of dread showered over me. Slow footsteps shown by the hallway night light approached my closed bedroom door. The hairs on my neck raised. My mom, my sister, and myself were the only ones in the household, *to my knowledge*. The footsteps staggered closer to my door. The silhouette of the shoes seemed to be larger, like that of a man's feet, but no man lived there.

I stared in dread at the shoes now directly behind the inch gap between the door and the wooden floor. Whomever or *whatever* it was just stood there, for about 10 or 15 minutes. He was so close to the door, his body was pressing the doors' latch against the strike plate. I don't remember falling asleep, but suddenly I was waking up to my alarm clock a few hours later. Time for school I guess.

This reoccurred the next few nights. At 3:14 a.m., the feet would drag themselves to my doorstep. I'd just stare wide-eyed and pray that I would never hear the sound of a hand turning the knob. Like a clumsy ice skater trying not to fall over, the shoes would drag themselves away after having stood nose to door for about 15 minutes.

After the third or fourth night of this happening I decided I'd plug in my mp3 again before I crashed that evening. Sure enough, music started blaring at 3:14 a.m., jolting me awake. I realized the man behind the door was nowhere to be found.

I left my mp3's homing system plugged in from then on only to have it die a few days later. I haven't seen the man behind my door since it died. Some nights all these years later I'll fall asleep wondering if it was some kind of reoccurring dream or sleep paralysis, making fun of myself for being so scared and naive...

I just went to bed not being really sleepy, and suddenly I heard light footsteps on the floor, like feet wearing sockets, without hearing any door sound beforehand. I froze in fear and hid myself under my pile of blankets, pretending to sleep, and just stayed there completely stuck. It just walked the corridor then entered my room, I heard it getting closer and closer.  It stopped when it was near my bed, I don't remember clearly but I think I could here someone's breathing. And after a few seconds, I felt very clearly the weight of a hand touching my back through the blankets. Just one touch, maybe 4 or 5 seconds, then I heard it going back to the corridor, and here again with no door sound, just disappear.

I was so scared I was unable to move for the next hour. I thought a lot, I wondered if it was a hobo or a robber who was testing open appartments and checked if there was someone. But the fact the door hadn't been opened and closed makes anything rational impossible to consider.

One night two buddies and I decided to sneak down there in the middle of the night to see if we could find us a ghost.. well, we did. We had to cross a field like 3/4ths of a mile long to get there and my buddy had the idea to record our trip on his old flip phone. Half way across the field my buddy with the phone and I stopped to wait on our other buddy because he was lagging behind. My buddy with the phone decided to go ahead and play what he had recorded up until that point.. The recording started out with all 3 of our voices audibly talking. You could hear one of my buddies say, ""This is seed tick central."" And the other, ""Not at night it isn't"", as if they don't come out at night lol then all of the sudden a totally (no other way to describe it) demonic sounding voice said, ""Help me!"" My buddy and I immediately looked at each other like yooo, wtf. As my other buddy caught up to us the voice then proceeded to say in a much more upset tone this time, ""GO AWAY!!!"", Gives me chills typing it.. we all 3 without saying a word took off running back to my house. My buddy was going so fast he cut himself deep enough to leave a scar trying to get under the barbed wire fence. We set around a tree outside my house playing that recording over, and over, and over, and over.. hearing the voices every single time. All 3 of us. The original recording was 1:27 seconds long. We decided to go to bed at like 5 am and as soon as we woke up the next day went immediately back to the recording.. but guess what?

For the first time ever I was experiencing hallucinations while driving in Georgia Wednesday night where it was foggy as fuck.

I'm a student truck driver for a company I'm trying to get in since it takes 3 weeks and this is week 3 for me before Christmas. So I was working the graveyard shift and had to drive all the way from Savanah, Georgia to Saint Paul, Minnesota since my Instructor drives all day and I drive all night to make it like a working clock.

I started my shift around 9:00 and would see if I can get to Indianapolis by morning. Around 11:00 came along and I was pretty much in Atlanta and for about 50 miles you could only see about 3 feet in front of you or less. Driving a big truck in fog while there's construction blockades made it even more stressful (Luckily not many people were out at that time being it was a work night)

But this is where shit starts to get crazy to where I would never expect to happen in my life...

Pretty much while I was driving I saw stuff manifest on the road and then dissappear, one of them being a shadow many or two running across the road in front of me. There was also a Bobcat work excavator that manifested right in front of me in the dense fog and I swear I hit my brakes pretty hard until I hit it and dissappeared (like once I got in close contact it vanished in the fog)

But it doesn't stop there when then voices in my head like it was general conversations people would have everyday and so on. In my head and for some reason I was responding to them with like ""Yeah"" and ""Ok"" then I realized quickly saying ""Who the fuck am I talking to?""

I think the scariest part was that when I left Atlanta and getting closer to Tennesee I swear... I felt the presence of a man sitting in the passenger chair of my truck. I couldn't get a good description of the man because I only saw some of him in the corner of my eye while driving. If I remember he was wearing a black trench coat and a fedora like hat with a white beard. But whenever I would turn my head over this presence wasn't sitting there anymore until my eyes were back on the road only to see him in the corner of my eye while I was focusing on the road (it wasn't my trainer because he was in the back sleeping since he worked earlier in the day)

Finally once I got to Tennessee it stopped for the rest of the trip and had to retrace my thoughts on what just happened exactly. I had to do my research by morning and found out it's common for Truck Drivers who experienced Driver Fatigue as it happens when you work long hours and don't get enough sleep, I was getting jacked on energy drinks to keep myself awake and it wasn't helping.

I am having a hard time processing a recent event so I figured I’d come here. 

Last week I was working in the kitchen. Home alone as my husband was at work and we don’t have kids or roommates. Just three cats. I was at the table working on my laptop. Next to me is a cup of tea, my phone and this book by Anne Taylor I had been inhaling. I had a thought to check to see if the mail had come, so I walked to the front into the front hall. Nothing so I return to the kitchen maybe 15 seconds later. 

Before I am even in the kitchen again I can see it: a penny sitting in the middle of the book cover. I had just been sneaking in a few pages 5 minutes before this whole thing started so it wasn’t me leaving it there, not to mention my country has phased out pennies several years ago favouring the round up system, so we really don’t have them just lying around the way we used to. It was an old penny, 1940, with King George on it. Flip side there are green oxidization marks on it due to old pennies having a higher copper content. Holding it in my hand I realize this is an old penny that my husband had found a few weeks ago. Finding it interesting he added it to his coin collection which he keeps in a bowl in his nightstand.

Just because sometimes things happen that seems to be out of the blue its most of the time not what your first conclusion is. Sounds that sounds like someone clapping in the other room can scare you at first but if you investigate it you just might find out that the wall mounted heater is a very convincing spook. That creek you heard can be just the house aging so alot of times things does have a rational explanation of what happened. This can be said for 90% of the time but there is the one thing that has been going on that has been leading to just more confusion, anxiety and is left without anything making any sense. This is that story.

I live on a farm in a house that was originally built with big logs. There has been put up more modern wood panels on the outside face to protect the building and have it look better in the more modern world. The log construction makes the house pretty loud as the wood ages over time and it expands and makes noise with the changing temperatures throughout the year. Im used to these sounds and they stand out and when you hear it from time to time you instantly know that its just the wood. There is the occasional mouse in the wall you can hear running inside the wall and these sounds are nothing out of the ordinary. The house makes sounds on very windy days aswell. You can hear the wind whistle around the corners of the house. All these sounds can be easily identified as just the house even tho they are far and few times in between each other. These sounds has been there all my life and im used to them. I know what exactly a sound is when i hear it since i have heard it many times before. These last few months have been different. New sounds are appearing that me and my family can’t explain. Its not a case of just the house since these sounds are weirdly unsettling and not the occasional loud bang in the floor or wall. The first time I noticed a sound was late at night being home alone in the wall next to my bed. It sounded like a scratch that started on the far side of the wall and it traveled across the wall from one side to the other. My first thought was that since there is a tree on the other side of that wall maby some wind could have brushed some branches against the wall and I thought nothing more of it. The second strange sound was something similar but in a totally different area of the house. I was in the living room with both of my parents watching TV. It sounded like something heavy was dragged across the floor upstairs. Just like the first time i heard the noise in the wall the sound traveled from one side and traveled across the surface and ended in a totally different area. As we were the only 3 people living there and everyone was in the same room this was unsettling for us all and I told the others about what i had heard in the wall a few days before this. My Dad went to go investigate to see if someone had broken in through the upstairs balcony but there was no sign of a break in or anything being moved. The day after i wanted to see if I could find an explanation for the sound i had heard in the wall so i went to investigate it from looking at the outside wall where i heard the sound. I had heard it from my bedroom on the second floor so it couldn’t be a person or animal as I looked at it being well out of reach to touch the wall at the height of my room. The tree on that side of the wall was too far away from the house to have branches brush up against the wall so investigating only lead to confusion. A week or so passed without any sounds but this was only the beginning. My dads business is just down the road from our house on the farm property so when everyone is out at work he is at home working in the building next door. Its just a walk down the road from the house so my dad takes his break in our house. He told me that one time during his lunch break there was yet another sound that was weirdly loud and out of the blue. He said that he heard someone walking around on the upstairs floor followed by a loud bang as if a door was thrown shut. His first instinct was to yell out for me if i was home as its not unusual for someone like me or my mom to be home early and without him being made aware. Since nobody answered him he went to investigate but that he didn’t find anyone at home or anything being out of place. My mom also has an experience with sounds that cant be explained and is the most unsettling of the weird things that happened by far. As the pandemic was at its worst her workplace went to keep working from home so she put up office in the living room. As I mentioned earlier my dad works in another building and is only in the house for lunch so my mom was alone. Since she was at home she had our dog with her and not with my dad as usual. Our dog is pretty calm and quiet. She only barks when she sees strangers outside of the house. We have a subscription on a weekly box of fresh food and vegetables getting delivered to our door with a dinner menu made by a chef for that week. The delivery is every Monday somewhat late in the evening in between 6 and 8 in the evening. Our dog always barks at the delivery guy and its a harmless reminder from our dog that “food is here”. This however was something completely different. Our dog barks at strangers outside giving us a warning that someone is approaching the house. My mom noticed that our dog was barking and looked up to find her not by the window as per usual but by the bottom of the stairs looking up. When she saw this she didn’t think so much of it but took our dog with her back to the living room. As she returned to work our dog went to lay down and relax and she thought just that it was a case of “pet.exe stopped responding” but that was not the case. A minute passed and she heard a bang from upstairs followed by the sound of glass breaking. Both my mom and our dog noticed this and my mom went to see what the heck fell over. She looked in every room looking for the crime scene full off broken glass. As you may have noticed the pattern here from all the previous times it might not suprise you that there was nothing to find. Nobody’s home. Nobody broke in. No glass was found. 
Had it been a case of one time or two I would have not given any thoughts about the whole situation but there is a clear pattern here. Its always from the upstairs area in and It’s making me feel anxious about the whole thing and if there is a next time what is going to happen",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936048,public,new,self,Something is going on at home and it’s starting to make anxious about what it is,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rkmeyp/something_is_going_on_at_home_and_its_starting_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To give some background, The room that I sleep in is I feel is seriously haunted, there are a lot of incidents, recently one night like 3 days ago, I generally sleep between 4-5 am in the morning cause I don't feel at ease in my room mostly ignore the things that go bump in the night and watch or listen to something as not to pay attention.

Now with the latest encounter.

It was around 3 am in the night, the room was dark. I saw someone(entity) walk in the room, I heard the door open and looked if anyone was there also the room was dark, I thought it was my mom as my mom has a habit to comes to the washroom, though she has a washroom nearer to her room. This night I was listening to maybe a podcast. I clearly saw this entity walk from the door as my room entry door makes very distinct noise, I heard that and looked up as the room was dark my eyes were adjusted to the dark the entity looked like a wispy white swirly and foggy but surely I could see, though I was scared I had didn't move just kept my eyes open, to observe the entity. It was just staying there and I felt its eyes on me constantly... it stayed there for around an hour then it disappeared. I don't know what was it. But a series of bad luck has been following since, fights at home, few losses, losing an almost set job interview, unease altogether. I've not told this anyone in the family.

Hello, so I had a really weird encounter the other day and I can’t stop thinking about it. It was around 6pm and I was having a nap in my room I live with my parents so it’s not uncommon for my dad to look in on me when he gets back from work to make sure I’m ok. 

I’m normally a dead sleeper nothing wakes me but on this day something woke me up and I look towards the door and it opens the person who I believed to be my dad looked in then shut the door and I heard footsteps on the stairs. I went back to sleep and when I woke up asked my dad if he’d looked in on me while wearing his dressing gown and he told me he hadn’t even been in my room to check in. 

The man I saw had dark hair and a dark dressing gown on and was fairly tall. Throughout that whole encounter I never felt unsafe just assumed it was my dad but looking back it wasn’t the right height or build for my dad.

I’ve explained to my girlfriend my sleep paralysis, and asked her to wake me up if she hears my breathing intensify as I cannot move or speak when experiencing episodes. Ever since moving in we’ve heard really unusual noises from around our unit(like a child banging on the walls and screaming at 3am) and even seen weird shadows around our apartment. I can’t say I really believe in the paranormal, but some of the recent events that have occurred to me are unexplainable. Sorry for the long background, but here’s where the story begins:

It happened a couple of weeks ago. I remember feeling off that night as if something wasn’t right. As we were getting ready to sleep, I remember hearing a high pitch noise in our room. Me being the man, I went to go investigate. Initially I thought it was the air coming from the vent above our tv, but as I go closer I heard it more clearly coming from the bathroom. I went into the bathroom and that’s when the ringing stopped. Confused, I told my gf it was nothing and decided to go to sleep. My gf takes forever to sleep, so she told me that she would be on her phone awhile until she got sleepy. Me being tired and all decided to go ahead and sleep. I usually fall asleep fast. After a few short minutes I remember waking up. I couldn’t talk or move, I knew I was experiencing sleep paralysis. I calmed myself like many times before and waited so I wouldn’t intensify the episode and hallucinate something scary. Keep in my everything was dark. That’s when out of the corner of my right eye I see a large human figure next to me trying to talk to me or someone, I’m not sure. I remember seeing the silhouette of a trench coat and some kind of hat on them. I remember feeling terrified, that’s when I turned my head to my girlfriend and started talking and telling her “wake me up”, “wake me up”. She turned around and shined her phone light onto me as I increased my breathing. She stared at me for a good minute and I remember thinking to myself “why doesn’t she wake me up?”. I was finally able to move my hand and reached for hers, and as I did, she pulled her hand away. I reached one more time and she finally woke me up. That’s when I quickly grabbed my phone and turned on my light. I asked her why she didn’t wake me up, and she said she didn’t know if I was having a nightmare or experiencing sleep paralysis. I quickly asked her why she pulled her hand away and said she didn’t. Turns out I had grabbed onto my own hand and woke myself up. She said she was scared because I was whispering and breathing heavily and also said I was asleep. I was confused because she said my eyes were closed and I was laying on my back, head in the pillow, but I clearly remember her turning around and shining her phone light onto me. In order to know if I was hallucinating or not, I described exactly how she was turned. She was leaning on her right elbow and holding her phone in her left hand. She confirmed that it was true. But how could I have seen her with my eyes closed and head straight? She then told me that she was already a little scared because she had seen a tall dark shadow out the corner of her eye next to the closet which is also next to me. She said she saw it a few minutes after I fell asleep, and shined her phone light onto it. She’s normally scared of the dark, so she thought it was just the outside light coming in through the windows. That’s when I turned pale and went to turn on the lights. I described to her the figure I saw, and then I remembered that my brother used to tell me of a man in a trench coat and fedora that would watch him at night when we were kids. I remember staying up that whole night out of fear. I don’t really know what happened that night, but it was very unusual. Like I said I don’t really believe in the paranormal, but her and me both seeing something does rule out the possibility of it just being sleep paralysis. This is a true experience, and it wasn’t a good idea to write this at 3am. I now have goosebump remembering this experience.

Il est 9h48. Premier post pour moi. J'imagine que j'en ai besoin. J'habite avec mon copain dans une maison sur deux étages en ville. Cette nuit, il commençait le travail à 5h. Il s'est levé à 4h20 pour partir vers 4H40. 

Je me suis réveillée et suis allée aux toilettes au moment où il partait. Quand il à ouvert la porte d'entrée, notre chat Bonnie en a profité pour filer dans la rue. Je descendais les escaliers quand mon copain passe la tête et pose le chat à l'intérieur. La porte était restée ouverte. Je n'y prête pas attention à moitié endormie. 

Je remonte me coucher. Moon notre autre chat demande à sortir dehors sur les toits. Je lui ouvre.

J'ai une petite manie quand mon copain ne dors pas avec moi, c'est de fermer la porte de ma chambre et de la verrouiller. Je ne sais pas, ça me rassure.

Bonnie vient gratter à la porte pour que je lui ouvre. Je referme derrière elle. Elle monte sur le lit et s'allonge entre mes jambes. Elle est collée à moi. 

Je m'endors enfin à 5h. 

6h22, On gratte à ma porte. Le bruit me réveille.

J'émerge. Je suis directement angoissée. Moon est dehors. Bonnie est entre mes jambes et je n'ai pas d'autres chats. 

Le grattement est bien distinct. Il dure quelques secondes. Il ressemble énormément au grattement de Bonnie. Il n'y a presque aucun doute. Ça vient de ma porte. J'ai le sommeil léger et j'étais clairement réveillée. Comme moi, je sens que Bonnie est alerté par le bruit. 

Au début, j'ai pensé à mon copain qui fait peu attention à fermer les portes à clés. Laisse les fenêtres ouvertes etc. j'ai cru que quelqu'un était chez moi. 

Je suis dans mon lit sans bouger, je décide d'attendre d'autres bruits. En soit mon étage est en bois. Le bois craque souvent quand il y a du chauffage. Il est éteint mais ce n'est pas rare d'entendre le bois craquer quand même. 

Le grattement, cette impression que quelqu'un est là. J'entends quelques bruits mais rien qui ne me prouve que quelqu'un est là.  Pas de bruits de pas. Je suis paralysée de peur. J'essaie de gérer ma respiration. De ne pas angoisser. Je pense à des plans pour m'échapper, j'essaie de savoir si il y a cambrioleur, un psychopathe.. je me dis que quelqu'un est rentré pendant que mon copain aller chercher le chat dehors, J'en sais rien.. 

Je suis rester éveillée jusqu'au levé du jour avant de trouver le courage de me lever. J'ai fais le tour de toute la maison sans trouver de réponses. 

Je suis sûre de ne pas avoir rêver mais je n'ai pas eu le courage d'aller ouvrir la porte. J'habite dans cette maison depuis mars dernier. je n'ai jamais senti de mauvaises ondes. Et j'ai clairement une sensibilité dans certains lieux. Je crois aux énergies pas forcément aux fantômes qui grattent aux porte !  Ici je n'ai jamais ressenti autre chose. Je ne peux pas expliquer ce qu'il s'est passé cette nuit.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936009,public,new,self,Fin de nuit bizarre,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rkjja6/fin_de_nuit_bizarre/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

so around the age of 9 my father passed away. i was in the 5th grade and wasn’t affected all that much it was new to me not having a father figure around. so my mom bought me a laptop for christmas which was 2 months after he passed.  after christmas passed it was like a week into owning this laptop and it was then i had my first strange experience, it was 12:30 at night and i just got done watching a youtube video and closed the laptop,plugged it in and got up to go to the bathroom which was just down the hall from the kitchen (where the laptop is) so i go to the bathroom and as i’m finished in the bathroom i heard something mumbling, kind of like someone talking in another room. but no one was awake. so i go into the kitchen after i washed my hands and the laptop was playing the video i had just finished watching which i didn’t think was a big deal because no computer is perfect and turned it on and turned it off and turned off the lights and went to bed within the next few weeks my mom experienced dishes and cups get thrown out of cupboards at her aswell as our cupboard doors would fly open and shut and slam.. etc etc during all of this i experienced a terror so bad it makes me tear up talking and typing about it. i don’t know the time frame around this but i remember it vividly i was going up the stairs and you know that feeling you get that someone is chasing you up the stairs? well i did. so i full sprint into my room and hid under my sheets and as i am laying there i hear a big bang and then like someone walking up the stairs but in this motion   left foot pause right foot on creaky wood stairs then followed by a LOUD bang like someone dragging a metal mace up the stair this continues for 3 or so steps then the person full blown sprints up the stairs and gets to the top and walks to the middle of my hallway and stops and breathes so heavily i could hear it through my door the person then turns around and full sprints down the stairs again ending in dead silence. i never knew what it was but it gives me nightmares to this day.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,936005,public,new,self,actual incounter with a demon or ghost.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rkj16d/actual_incounter_with_a_demon_or_ghost/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We lived by the park so we walked there as we normally would. Since we were taking pictures, we thought to get away from the roads and people so we decided to walk all the way to the back of the park.

As we’re making our way into the empty park, the sky was getting darker. This park I’d visit quite often in the daylight made we feel peaceful; however, this time I had a strange feeling. I am not someone who gets scared easily. In fact, at this age I was a huge horror movie fan and had always wanted to experience something paranormal. I didn’t express the strange feeling to my sister because I didn’t want to spook her out. 

We had finally got to the back and found the perfect tree to take pictures by. I stood in front of the tree and she started taking photos (with my iPhone 5s). After a few shots, we viewed them. To our surprise, we saw an orb in front of me. We both looked at each other and she questioned, “What is this?!”

I tried to remain calm and said, “Maybe it’s the lighting...” So I took pictures of just the tree as the lighting changed, with flash and without. We viewed them. There was still the orb in the exact same spot. I decided to swing my arm in the area of the orb to see if there was a spider web, bug, or tree particles falling down. Right after I swung my arm, I walked a circle around the orb area while I taking photos. Once I went 360 around and captured shots, we viewed them. Sure enough the orb was still there on every. single. shot. We were so freaked out we ran straight home.

After getting home we were really wondering if what we had captured was a ghost. We went on the internet and googled the park. As we read the information, I felt a rush of goosebumps. It turns out a man hung himself from a tree a few years back at that exact park. My sister and I just looked at each other in horrified silence. I still wonder if that tree was where the man was.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,935988,public,new,nsfw,Spirita underneath a tree...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rkhbr7/spirita_underneath_a_tree/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This quickly escalated when I was sleeping and was woken up because I heard someone move a bag that was on the floor next to my bed. When I opened my eyes I saw who I thought was my husband (it was dark so I could only see a figure) standing next to me. I asked what he was doing and he didn’t answer, just stood there. I asked again “what the heck are you doing, why are you just standing there” and I was staring at this figure when my husband, in bed next to me, wakes up and mumbled something. I lost it, started screaming. At this moment the figure turned and started walking to the window and I saw the curtains move.

We pretend like we felt something scary and then laugh it off and go to the next location but this time was a little different for me. We found out about an old abandoned insane asylum (I think it was abandoned in the 90's) that is supposedly extremely haunted and we decided to try and find it. When we got to the street that we found on google, I felt a pit in my stomach. 

This was different than all of the other times we had gone to ""haunted"" locations, I knew something bad happened close to where we were. I was anxious I'm not going to lie, but I'm also the type of person to watch horror movies by myself and lead my friend group into a haunted house. The anxiety level I was feeling was similar to waiting outside of a haunted house so for me, it wasn't too extreme. All of the sudden, as we're driving, tears just start coming out of my eyes. I definitely wasn't crying out of fear or anxiety. I've felt that before. My feelings weren't extreme enough in that moment to be crying like how I was. I wasn't sobbing, I was just having a normal conversation with my friends but my eyes were just... crying. It felt like it was out of my control. I couldn't stop it either. We ended up going back to my friend's place because we couldn't see the asylum and it was also getting late. 

When we got back to her place, we found the actual address for the asylum and it was on the other side of the trees where I started crying. I knew we were close to the place when I started crying but we were quite literally Next to it and none of us had any idea.

I remember freezing when I heard it the first time and trying to come up with a rational explanation for what I was hearing, but it definitely wasn't air conditioning or a draft. It sounded just like someone else was in the room with me, just breathing heavily. After about a minute of being frozen in fear I found the courage to go downstairs. This happened probably six or so times in the time I lived there. The only time this happened outside of my room was on my birthday when I was playing hide and seek inside with my friends. I was hiding behind a chair downstairs in the computer room and my friends were in another part of the house, and that same breathing started again right beside me. You can bet that I gave up that game quick! Oddly enough this never happened at night, only in the daytime.


The other strange thing is that was the only house I would ever sleepwalk in. About every other night I would go to sleep upstairs in my bed and wake up downstairs on the living room couch. It was pretty horrible waking up down there and then being scared, having to run upstairs back into my room in the dark. My mom said one time a noise woke her up and she came out to me trying to walk down the railing of the stairs like a balance beam, and even more creepy was the time she woke up to me just standing and staring at her watching her sleep in her bed. I don't have any memory of that of course, but ever since we moved out I've never had anything like that happen again.


Something of note is that my dad wasn't home for about three of the years we lived there due to being deployed in Iraq, so this isn't something I ever mentioned to him. Recently we were talking about that old house as I had looked it up out of curiosity and saw that it had been demolished, and I mentioned the breathing I heard. That's when my dad looked at me and told me he used to hear the same thing in that house as well. He also told me that the previous owner was a child molester with his own daughter being one of the victims.


Now I'm officially creeped out by the whole ordeal and just thinking about it gives me chills, but I'm also left with a lot of questions. Could the creepy breathing I heard be the spirit of the old owner if he's still out there alive? Is it possible that the bad energy and emotions surrounding him and/or his victims lingered in the house after they had left? I believe a lot of things can be explained by science, but maybe it is possible for very negative energy to linger in a place and ""haunt"" it. 


The next house we moved to was a 200 years old and had multiple people die in it, yet I never had a paranormal experience there. I'd love to hear other people's thoughts or experiences.

As an example, I had a face moisturizer that I used ever single day. I left it in the same spot, in my bathroom cabinet. One morning I couldn’t find it but figured I set it somewhere dumb. Couldn’t find it for weeks, in a studio apartment where there were only so many places it could be. I took everything out of the cabinet and put everything back twice, not because I really loved this product, but just because it was bothering me that I couldn’t find it. Fast forward, I open my cabinet, and it’s right there. Where it always was. 

This is just one example, other things that have gone missing are an eye mask for sleeping, remotes that appear right on the table where I always kept them etc. 

Things also appear that I’ve never seen before. In my new apartment, separate from the one where the other story happened, a weird little pack of stickers showed up in a cabinet. It’s one of those tiny medicine cabinets that is a mirror with a couple shelves behind it. I had JUST moved in, and put a few things in there. I sure wouldn’t put stickers in there. One day I open it and there’s a little pack of sparkly stickers. Another thing is a random pair of scissors I’ve never seen before appeared in my kitchen drawer. Again, I had just moved in and put spoons etc in that drawer. I open it one day and right on top sitting on everything else is a pair of red scissors I’ve never seen before. My other two pairs were also in there. 

Nothing sinister, just weird and creepy and it makes me question myself. Finding things I’ve been looking for for WEEKS in the spots they’re supposed to be makes me feel nuts, and the new things I’ve never seen before just feels creepy.

Just 3 days ago me and my friend went up to Walmart, there’s this pavement trail up by my neighborhood basketball court, and all of a sudden 3 people almost practically materialized in front of us.

We thought nothing of it at first, as the trail is commonly taken. However upon closer inspection the people looked just like our 3 friends, down to an exact point. Normally I would have no problem with this however one of the friends had gone to Georgia and the others were at their house.

Around this point we got creeped out but oh well, might as well keep going. We get about half way up the trail and one of our friends voices calls out, the voice being exact in cadence, tone, you name it.

This is where things got weirder. Me and my friend both turned to each other and asked if that was really our friend. From there we braced ourselves for a silly jump scare and turned the corner of the trail and they were gone.

We kept going and saw them again, this time in a home goods parking lot on the way there. We were able to get a good look at them as we were far enough away to not be detected but close enough to get details. I saw one of them, our younger friend of the group, was standing at an angle. I checked his face for identifiable features but, there was no face. I mean like there was no features whatsoever on his face. It mortified me.

The others turned around a little bit at the same angle as they were preparing to get to the next part of the trail that lead directly to Walmart. Their faces were all contorted. I mean like physically impossible kind of contorted. Then I realized they were following a particular pathway we followed about a month ago. I mean down to foot placement, people placement, everything.

They rounded the corner and we followed not far behind. They were gone. Entirely gone. I mean no trace, nothing. Like they didn’t exist.

I brought this up with one of the friends we supposedly encountered and she FREAKED OUT. She was more freaked by the fact that them taking the trail meant they were nearby than anything else. It’s sort of become a taboo topic but I think they’ve followed me home.

Just today I was taking out the garbage and down through this alleyway there was a voice speaking to me. It was that same friends voice, but just ever so noticeably yet slightly distorted. I turned and there was three figures, shrouded in shadow. Their outlines were the same as those very “friends” I had encountered. Needless to say I finished taking out the trash at lightning speed.

I don’t really see this as anything extreme right now, I’m more just looking for closure on what happened, I don’t need anything immediately right now.

Although im a disorganized schizophrenic and dont typically hallucinate or have delusions. However before i got on meds i started seeing paranormal things. I remember i had hallucinations of flesh eating maggots eating me from the inside, i would smell smoke and hallucinate i was on fire without any pain other than mild warmth, id see the girl from the ring, shadow people, and demonic creatures that would either stare at me when i wasnt looking or just hang out in my room when i was sleeping or not home. Id walk in on them and stare at them, theyd turn, see me, recognize i could see, then run away from me frantically and were scared of me. Usually when schizoaffectives hallucinate they see shadows out of the corner of their eyes which when i told my first psychiatrist they wrote that down even though i specified i looked at them directly.

Also to be noted, my sister died when i was 4 and a year or so later i hallucinated a grim reaper that looked at me while i stared at it, seemed puzzled i could see it, then walked off quickly. I didnt have hallucinations until a while after.

Ive been known to follow my hallucinations after they runaway but they walk through walls and disappear so i can never keep following them. When i started taking meds they went away but ill never forget the time i was alone sleeping one night, i left the lights on, then someone shut it off so i woke up and just saw a shadow person staring at me. Then it ran away as i stared directly at it. I ran out of the room thinking the lightbulb went out and triggered a hallucination. However when i came back in the room, i was able to turn the light on like nothing happened. 

Also one time i had a dream where a dead girl that i had been hallucinating for a while. Appeared in my dream where she was staring at me in the mirror in my bathroom but i didnt have a reflection. I woke up and the spot i was standing in the dream started having water come out of it from seemingly nowhere in real life. I started throwing towels down but it wouldnt stop. I was a teenager so i got my parents and they called maintenance which said theyd be their immediately. They got there and told me the water heater in my closet was about to explode and if we had called any later it would have exploded which could have seriously injured, burned or killed me.

Sometimes i wonder if it was real or just random chance :/
And why would they run away when i was friendly??
I also never had hallucinations around other people, only when alone minus once when i was at a therapists office, walking through a hallway, and looked into a dark room and saw that creepy ass girl from the ring staring at me.

My Granda didn't want to leave me in the house myself so he told me to come take the dog out with him, we go into the Forest as best place to walk the dog, mid walk the dog got off the leash and ran off into the darkness and out of sight, Granda told me to stay exactly where I was and he'd be back soon.

A little later as I wait I heard my Granda calling my name so I begin to walk towards him calling out that I can't see him as it's too dark and I continue to follow his voice, he kept calling out my name as I get closer to him but before I reach the voice i'm grabbed from behind.... by my Granda who has the dog. He scolds me as he told me to stay where I was and how i'd given him a fright, I told him how he shouted on me and I was going to him, turns out he hadn't called my name at all or shouted for me and he certainly hadn't been down that way deeper into the woods.

Ever since I was little, I’ve been having vivid dreams that I never really understood. Not every night, most nights were nonsensical— but some nights, the important ones, were the nights that I would dream of situations that felt all too real. 

One dream, I was at outdoor assembly and my principal had this distinct paisley suit on, talking about natural disaster safety— I wore new white shoes in this, standing on a yellow line belonging to a basketball court marking. A girl from another grade passed out in the middle of assembly, ambulances were called, and I woke up. Upon waking, I was in an immense haze, almost like I couldn’t remember what to do next. It was short, and while I remembered the dream during the haze, I quickly forgot. I was a kid, after all. 

Weeks later, I was standing at outdoor assembly. I had just gotten new shoes. I remember looking down at them and getting this sense of deja vu; my mom was a volunteer that day, so I tugged on her arm. I told her what I saw in my dream, the suit, the girl, and she told me that wasn’t going to happen. When my principal walked out in that suit, and when that girl fainted, my mom regarded it as strange coincidence.

That’s how it always happened. Dream, sudden waking, forgetting, haze time passing. Deja vu, and the event— and remembering, but only once it was triggered by the deja vu. 

Lately, I have been experiencing more intense dreams when this happens. It feels as if the older I get, the more experience I have, the more significant the dreams are. The less I check myself and remind myself that this happens, the worse they get. Had a dream of my soulmate-friend passing before it happened. Had a dream of the first time I told my current partner that I love them. I saw my cousin nearly drive us off the road in another. 

I am not sure what to do, and I am open to conversation. I don’t know what this is. But it’s beginning to get the best of me, and I fear it is because I don’t acknowledge or practice it.

So this story doesn't sound convincing and I know that, but it really happened and I still think about it occasionally.

It was 2am and I was laying in bed about to go to sleep. I had no lights on and I was texting with a friend of mine who lived a few hours away from me (by car). While we were texting I suddenly saw a blue orb, the size of a adult head, floating in the middle of the room. It was there for maybe 1.5 or 2 seconds and then it vanished quite suddenly. It was a strong blue, the light looked almost like the light from a laserpointer, except the orb seemed not just like a ball of light but more like something solid or maybe liquid. It was wavering also, so it wasn't just a completely round ball. It did not emit light at all, even though it was quite bright.

I was kind of shocked when I saw it and turned on the lights right after it vanished. I went to the spot where the orb had just been but there was nothing, everything was perfectly normal. I laid back down and texted my friend ""You won't believe what just happened"" and she immediately texted back ""Did you just see a blue light?"". I confirmed and she told me she had the exact same experience a few minutes earlier. I just don't understand why we would have the same experience almost simultaneously even though we were so far away from each other.

I googled blue orbs and tjere is not much to find, some people say blue orbs are angelic beings that visit you with good intent. I am still baffled.

The entry to my door was blocked by a figure, tall and darker than the void of space. Whatever it was,
it looked back at me with judging white eyes. I was shocked, I believed it had to be my imagination. 

Then I looked at my dog.

He stared at the figure too, starting a low growl. This is the moment I was sent to horror. He saw the figure too. I looked to the slender entity, it slowly shrunk down into the floor, both me and my dog

I don’t remember all of them but it’d be one that i’d be paralyzed in my bed, unable to move or speak. My house was on fire and there was an evil woman coming towards me, and a guy i guess her sidekick.

Every time i had this dream I woke up right before she got me, bc I was clenching my hands so hard they’d bleed. every single time. 

i’d also see stuff or shapes i guess (irl),a face, i still can’t understand what it was, hovering over me. also i could see my neighbor and his damn green lightning. he was zooming in his apartment, my sister didn’t believe it until she saw it herself. I don’t know what it was but that guy or spirit was running all over the place. And it was really fast, if you’d blink, you could miss it. Almost seems like it was messing with me, I don’t know, that apartment is empty for years now.

anyway, this nightmare stopped and then i had dreams, first a bird was staring at me outside my window, a beautiful white bird. 

dream after dream the bird was inside now but later on the bird disappeared and a man replaced it. he was sitting on my sisters bed, watching me. 

he never talked but i knew what he wanted me to do, he was speaking in my head yet i couldn’t hear his voice. He brought me a dog, through the window, and i had to keep it a secret. I love dogs and my family didn’t want one, so i think that was “he’s” way of getting closer to me.

i remember i felt somewhat protected or at peace when I was dreaming of him. he’d want me to hide him, i don’t exactly remember all of my dreams with him but hed appear often. 

I thought he was my guardian angel honestly. he’d bring me stuff and he was nice. once in my dream we were with my whole family outside and i’d be talking with him yet my family couldn’t see him. he said to not tell them he was there, and i asked why and he said they wouldn’t understand.

i think that’s the last time i dreamt of him.
anyway next dream i had, more like nightmare, something was hunting us, me and my little sister. 

i don’t have a little sister, i am the little sister, but anyway it turns out it was our mom.
“
my little sister” didn’t look related to me at all and she ended up killing her and sucking her blood out with a machine or something. 

the mom in my dream didn’t look like my irl mom but i knew she was her. yet i started running after my sis killled her and i found my real mom and i was yelling for help. weird marks or scratches somehow started appearing on my arms with a weird looking B and symbols, i was bleeding.

that was the last nightmare i had, and aside from the dreams and nightmares i’d always hear weird stuff or feel like someone’s watching me. Sometimes the lights would flicker or i’d hear noise in the house, as if someone is in, for example, the kitchen. Sometimes i’d see some figures like someone standing in the corner but it’d disappear.

after that nightmare my mom put a picture of saint Mary on the wall in my room and everything stopped.

the man that watched me sleep, never showed up again. and after a while i realized he might not have been an angel because if he was why would he leave? And why would he hide from my family? The way he tried to come closer to me is weird, giving me something I want but i have to keep it a secret…Doesn’t make sense to me.
I know these were dreams but somethings is wrong. 

I think that man is back. or whatever it is, i don’t know if  it’s something evil or not but i think it’s back because i felt something kick me on my back, the other night and i’ve been hearing stuff again. I was in the shower and I could hear stuff going on outside, sometimes I can hear it messing with the door, trying to open it, even though it’s locked.

how can i find out what this thing is and what does it want from me? Or if it’s evil? How could I protect myself and family?

I have autism so I am normally very critical of the world around me and like to find an answer to everything, but some things I have discovered, simply cannot be explained.

One of my earliest encounters, well the earliest that I can remember, has stuck with me for what feels like an eternity and I can still remember with great detail. I've told this story in the past, though much shorter for the sake of conversation, to family and friends and though some who believe in the paranormal may listen with great interest, those on the more sceptical side of things always tell me that it was ""just a dream"". And whilst sometimes I do question whether it was or not, the reality is that it was way too real to be put down as just a bad nightmare.

This is my first time ever writing it down with excessive detail and it's thanks to a recent discussion about the night in question with my nan today that I finally have all the details to make this story complete. This is a long one and happened when I was around 7 years old so do bare with me whilst I bring to light every detail that I can. So, on to my story.

It was the summer of 2002 and my family had booked a holiday in North Wales England in a small seaside town called Morfa Nefyn. I was 7, my brother 5 and my baby sister who was coming up to her 1st birthday. We were also joined by my grandparents and my Aunt Laura. My grandparents had paid for the place that we were staying in and also rented a large people carrier type car so that we could all travel together in without having to drive both of their cars from Norfolk, to where we lived in South London and then all the way to North Wales. It worked out better that way and no one wanted to split us kids into two cars and face arguments of ""who wants to ride with nan and who wants to ride with grandad"". An argument that always broke out between us on other family holidays.

When we got to the house that we were staying in, I remember being in awe at the sheer size of the giant white building before us and thinking just how much it would have cost to rent. I asked my nan this exact question and she simply shrugged it off and said ""It wasn't much"". She simply wanted our family to enjoy ourselves without worrying about the cost of it, something that didn't come naturally to a family that was already used to the thin line of poverty.

The house itself was a large white building that was split into two floors, large living room and kitchen diners on each floor and about 14 bedrooms in total. I equated the house to be more of a mansion than a house, it was simply that big compared to my 7 year old self. The house also had a large garden that sloped up the steep hill that my parents considered too dangerous for us to play in due to the landscaping and jutting rocks, but I do remember pestering my dad throughout our stay to let me go outside by the back patio to see the strange birds that had made a nest in a small passage way by the back door. My nan told me that they were swifts and I was fascinated by them, I loved birds and the city only ever had pigeons and house sparrows, they seemed so boring in comparison.

And though the swifts were exciting to my animal loving, autistic self, the most exciting part of this house was getting to choose a room that I could have all to myself. Back home, we had a small, 2 bedroom house and my siblings and I were crammed into one bedroom. Good old council estate living, so I was more than pleased to spend a week in my own bed, in my own room away from my brother and my baby sister. The room I chose was on the ground floor at the end of a corridor, literally the furthest room from the others as I could find and by sheer luck, I was the only one in that corridor. My parents chose a room a little past that corridor so that they could keep an eye on me and my brother who also had the same idea to choose a room as far from me as possible. It wasn't long before the sun started to set and as my parents and grandparents sat in the living room upstairs chatting away with a glass of wine, I decided to head to bed to relax and let the long car ride wash away in a mountain of pillows and deep sleep. I loved my sleep and knowing that I would be able to sleep without any disturbances from my siblings, felt like a blessing.

Little did I know that my dreams of solitary sleep weren't going to last for long

Whilst I slept soundly on the first night and woke up refreshed and ready to explore the nearby beach and travel inland for some sightseeing with my family, the 2nd night was completely different. We got back, had some dinner, enjoyed a bit of TV as my brother and I played on the patio out back. The sun started to go down and my dad called us both inside to start getting ready to go to bed. Me, still be fascinated by the swift nest, looked up at it and pleaded to my dad to let me stay until I saw the parents come back as I didn't want the eggs to be lonely. They hadn't hatched just yet so I was confused as to why I hadn't heard the mummy bird on them tonight. My dad just told me that she was sleeping, just as I should be, I admitted defeat and followed him inside and turned to go down to my room to grab my pyjamas and just.....froze.

The corridor that my room was located down, was suddenly so much darker than it was the previous night. Something within me told me not to go down there, that it was dangerous and spooky, I was thoroughly creeped out. I felt the hair on my arms stand up and chills ran down my back. I felt like something was about to jump out of the dark, attack me and devour me in one. I ran to my parents in the living room and pleaded with them to let me sleep in a different room, I was hysterical and crying, nearly at the point of a meltdown and just as my dad was about to compromise and let me switch rooms with my brother, my mother stepped in and told me to ""suck it up"" and that because I chose that room, I was stuck with it. Yeah, she wasn't a good mother and it would be another 15 years before I saw her for who she really is but that's a whole other story.

So i sulked back to my room. I was stuck with it and there was nothing that I could do other than push past my fears and try and get some sleep. I cried in silence that night, knowing that I was alone, scared and that my mother didn't care that I was so terrified. Eventually, I fell asleep thinking of the swift nest and the little eggs that were up there, hoping that I would see the babies hatch before our holiday ended.

Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. I tossed and turned endlessly, struggling to get comfortable and settle down, knowing that the spooky corridor was just a few feet away and my mothers words playing in my mind over and over again, I felt so hopeless but I couldn't speak up about it knowing that my emotions would be dismissed, just like they always were. Eventually, I let the fatigue take over and carry me away into a deep sleep, I just let my brain shut off and I drifted to sleep. I wasn't asleep for long, maybe 2 hours before I was awoken by a noise that sounded just like a growl, right by my ear.

My eyes burst open and I was immediately met with two red glowing eyes, right in front of my face. Standing in front of the window was a large dog, bigger than I had ever seen, with thick, shaggy black fur and a muzzle curled up in a snarl, showing off it's slightly yellowed, long canine teeth. Looking back, it looked like an Irish Wolf Hound in size and shape but with longer, ragged, jet black fur. Without thinking I clenched my eyes shut and flipped over in bed, simply thinking that I was still asleep and that it would simply go away. But as I laid there, I heard the growl again right in front of me. I opened my eyes and quickly shut them as the dog was now on the other side of the bed, still growling with its head low like it wanted to get down to my eye level and stare into my soul. I flipped over again to face the window and the dog was there again. No matter which way I faced, the dog would be there, snarling, staring, a low growl escaping its mouth. Loud enough to hear but not loud enough for any of the adults to hear. I was alone and couldn't escape and no help was coming. I don't know what drove me to do it, but after turning over for about the 10th time I though ""screw it"" and with my eyes glued shut I sat up as quickly as I could and reached to turn on the lamp on the bedside table.

The moment the room filled with light, the growling stopped. I slowly opened one eye and to my surprise, it had worked, the dog was gone. But I was still terrified, I didn't want to turn the light off as it seemed to be keeping the giant dog at bay and I didn't want to go to sleep, only to be woken by the dog again. I must have sat awake for a good half an hour, pondering where it had gone and whether it was real or not before finally putting it down to just a bad dream and that I had truly woken up when I turned the lamp on, everything else that I thought had happened, I was actually asleep for.

So, I laid back down and flicked the lamp off, ready to drift off again now that I had finally calmed myself down and rationalised the situation. I had dreamt it all, projected my fears about the hallway into the shape of a dog and let paranoia take over. Oh how wrong I was.

I had only closed my eyes for a few minutes before I heard the growling again but this time, much louder and at the foot of the bed. I kept my eyes closed and stayed as still as possible, praying silently that it would go away. Instead, I felt the foot of the mattress sink down as it started to climb on to the bed, the growling getting louder and louder as it inched closer to me. I was terrified and frozen in fear as I felt one of its giant paws press against my leg through the covers, its claws digging into my thigh above my knee. It was right on top of me now and I could feel its breath through its snarled teeth landing on my cheek. I don't know what drove me to do it, but I opened my eyes. Curiosity? Maybe, but i did it and came face to face with those haunting red eyes mere inches from my own and I let out the most blood curdling scream I had ever made in my short 7 years of life.

Within seconds, I heard frantic footsteps running towards my room and the door was flung open. My mother found me curled up on my bed, screaming between sobs and erratic as I looked around the room. The dog was gone, for good this time it seemed. My mother comforted me as I tried my best to tell her everything and she wiped away my tears with her sleeve. Of course, she didn't believe me and put it down to a bad dream and told me that ""dreams don't hurt you"" and that it's ""all in my head"". Her usual go to whenever I spoke about anything that upset me and to be honest, I kind of expected it. She put me back to bed when I eventually stopped crying and somehow, I fell back to sleep without incident.

The ""dreams don't hurt you"" nonsense was a clear lie come morning because by the afternoon, a large bruise had started to form where the dogs paw dug into my thigh. It hurt so bad that I spent the rest of our holiday hobbling around North Wales with my nan's hiking stick just to aid me. There's even a picture of me somewhere of me and my brother standing in front of a steam train a few days after this incident occurred and I had that hiking stick in my hand. The rest of the holiday carried on without any other issues, I switched rooms to the one closest to my parents room and I never saw the black dog again. Overall, I enjoyed Wales and the quiet town of Morfa Nefyn. We would spend our evenings walking down to the beach and playing in the sand, me and my brother even made friends with a few local kids and we would play in the sand, digging a hole so big that we could all fit in and quickly named it ""The Bunker"".

And if you're wondering about the swift nest, the babies hatched just two days before our trip ended and we were greeted every morning until we left by the sound of very hungry, featherless chicks begging their parents for food. I didn't want to leave them and sorrowfully waved goodbye to them when it was finally time for us to leave and head back to our little South London home.

Though this was most definitely an up close and personal encounter with a black dog, I didn't know that black dogs were a thing of legend across Wales and much of the UK until I told this story to a friend in college and she told me that it was a Black Dog. I did more research into it and sure enough, she was right. The pictures I found of the Welsh Black Dog ""Gwyllgi"" matched what I saw that night almost perfectly and it's said that if you see this creature at night, death is certainly not far behind.

And death did follow, I found the dates and double checked with my dad at the time and sure enough, my great great grandad passed away due to a heart attack exactly 2 weeks after that night.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,935815,public,new,self,My first paranormal experience I came face to face with a black dog,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rk56u1/my_first_paranormal_experience_i_came_face_to/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I was on a two week work trip, she said she felt a presence in her room while she was sleeping, though she felt she was awake, like someone was in her room. She works night shift so this was during the day between 7 AM and 7 PM

We've spent the night together a couple times since then and there hasn't been an incident together or on her own. 

I stayed the night last night, and she had to work so I was by myself. While I slept, I felt the same experience. Like someone was in the room with me, and while rolling around I only felt like I saw glimpses of them, near the door, near the closet, and specifically under the bed. 

She hasn't felt this anywhere else and she JUST moved into this apartment complex last month. I've never had this experience before.

Our only suspicion is either a physical intruder with a key, who I would've woken up to, or the mirror in her closet, which was in the same spot both times.

I was there by myself and it is in the middle of nowhere so its unlikly that anyone else was there. here is the link so you can take a look -https://youtu.be/PLtiWbOlivA , I left a timestamp in the comments. 

If you watch the video you can see a white wire hanging from the celing at the end of the corridor and what looks like a dark figure that runs accross in front of it, I dont personaly beleve in ghosts it could be something outside that makes a shadow appear like a bird flying past the window or the wind blowing the wire into the shade creating the apearence of a shadow but I just cant help seeing a figure.

I havent found any haunting history or anything about the hotel but it has burned down 3 times since it was built in 1796. It had a rebuild in the 1960s but burned down shortly after and was rebuilt but burned down again in 2014 and has been abandonded since.

I’m not sure how to explain this and it I honestly had to be reminded it even happened because it’s like my brain blocked it out. But my girlfriend recently reminded me and it triggered a fight or flight response in me instantly.

We were driving on 87 headed towards Raton (if you’re familiar with New Mexico) and to our right, up ahead on the road we both saw an extremely tall, slender, and shadowy black figure. It almost looked like an Enderman from Minecraft, definitely look it up if you’ve never played the game because it is the only thing that I can think of that would adequately describe its appearance. 

As we approached this thing, it wasn’t changing in appearance. When my girlfriend noticed it initially I thought it was a trick of the eye or just some kind of optical illusion. But it looked the same until the moment we became parallel with it. It suddenly became an out of time dressed old man pulling some kind of wooden cart. He just looked at us as we rolled past and then disappeared behind us.

This is way in the middle of nowhere, with 29 miles between the nearest towns. 

I’m not saying it wasn’t an illusion, but we weren’t road weary as this was in the first hour of the second day of driving. We were both well rested, and we both saw the exact same thing. Not even to mention the fact that this guy looked hunched over and 70+ years old, essentially 30 miles away from the nearest place to stop. This was also in late August so it was in the low to mid 80’s Fahrenheit.

Again, it pains me to say it but I’m running out of any logical explanations given all of the above factors.

A few months ago a few unexplainable things started happening. The first was a forgotten item, buried in storage for over a year appearing on our bed. Around that same time I made some toast in the kitchen, went to the living room, went back a few minutes later to find my large, heavy toaster flipped upside down. 

That was it for while. Now we’re both being touched. The first touch happened to my boyfriend. I was sleeping on the couch while he was sitting up beside me. He said he felt something touch his shoulder which made him jump and look over at me; thinking I did it, but quickly realized I didn’t. He said it creeped him out bad enough to gave him goosebumps. He admitted the touch was very light so he wasn’t 100% if something did touch him or if there was a wrinkle in his shirt, so he brushed it off. A few days later when I was home alone I felt the exact same thing. It was enough to make me jump and look to see who was behind me, but too light to definitely think something did touch me. 

A few days ago I was laying in bed. My boyfriend was downstairs. I was laying on my side when I felt something behind me. It touched my back. I turned to see if my boyfriend came up, but nope nothing there. I told my boyfriend about it. He was stunned and said the same exact thing happened to him a few days prior. He brushed it off, but after hearing I had the same experience he was freaked out.

Up to this point we could admit that this is getting weird, but not totally convinced it’s paranormal because the touches are just too light to be sure - until this morning. 

I woke up at 5am and was having a hard time falling back asleep. I was alone in bed while my boyfriend was downstairs. While laying there something TOUCHED my foot. I jumped up to look and surprise - there was nothing there. There was absolutely no more questioning it. It wasn’t light and I was wide awake so it wasn’t a dream. I ran my ass downstairs so fast. 

It just seems like things are progressing and I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. I think it’s one thing when things fall or get moved around, but getting physical?

We had moved in to our present residence in the fall of 2010 and experienced quite a bit of activity. I would see anything from black or white masses, images of unknown people, green orbs, cold spots, and water on the floor where none should be. Many of these experiences were singular events, but what I am about to relate really took the cake.

I woke up, and yes I was fully awake, and was lying on my left side. What was manifesting was a scene that was incomplete at best. I could see four figures, in a circle, but only one was actually clear, This entity was on the right of the circle, talking to the other three and had a glass in his hand. I could actually see his mouth move, but there was no sound. The whole scene seemed was grainy, like an old time nickelodeon film. This figure could be seen in the grainy part, but the other three were in shadows. Also I could still see the outline of the closets beyond. After what seemed like quite a while, but was probably less than a minute, the scene just faded out of view.

Who this person would have been, was a puzzle at first, but I had my suspicion. It was later confirmed it was my biological father's father. I was always told that this man doted on me, and was highly thought of by my Mom's family, whereas my seed provider did not and was not. That person walked out on my Mom when I was two, and I saw him one time, until he passed away in 2013. I didn't remember my Grandfather and he passed in 1967, when I was 16. I was given a picture by my half brother, which confirmed who was in the manifestation. The idea that he could still be around actually around kind of made sense, as that was denied in life.

This isn't related 

I live in a flat with three flatmates and my boyfriend. I don't know the history of the house but it's not super new I don't think. Also my dad suddenly passed away two months a go.

A couple of days after he passed away, I was in the kitchen one night getting a late night snack after he passed I saw a clear outline of a figure standing in the doorway. It felt positive and I also would have liked to see my dad in any form at this time so I kind of looked at it then continued on with what I was doing. I go to open the fridge, the lights are low it's fairly dark in the kitchen and so the fridge light is pretty bright. A dark shadow darts past in front of my field of vision super fast, blocking the light from the fridge for a second. I did find this strange as the presence with the neon aura that I saw felt so positive and then suddenly its a dark shadow. Anyway I concluded it was either my dad as he was known to have late night snacks too paying me a visit, or that I was going a bit loopy from the stress and imagining things.

Tonight my boyfriend and I are having dinner and we are discussing paranormal things, magical things, just having a fun discussion. My boyfriend says I wish magic was real, and I said 'Magic is real' and then the lights in the room flicker half a second after. They don't usually flicker so it was unusual. The energy in the room was so overwhelming at this time we both felt it.

Later tonight my boyfriend is on the phone with his dad telling him the spooky story about what happend and saying I think there is a ghost in our house. And then he said the lights flickered again right after he said that.

I am finding the timing of the lights flickering based on what we were discussing unusual and feel there may be a ghost in the house. I don't know if it is my dad or not :( 

Why is the ghost suddenly acting up now after a year of me living here and years or my boyfriend living here I think it could be my dad... 

How do I know if it's a friendly visitor or maybe a negative spirit.

The only other detail is we actually sometimes burn sage, and Palo Santo. I had recently burnt some sage because we had a flat Inspection just to hide smell of a cat that we aren't supposed to have, maybe this upset a spirit in the house. But it wasn't the first time I had done it

She is rather fond of it. I don't mind it at first either. It's cute. If you squeeze its left wing or its protruding tongue, it quacks the tune ""Jingle Bells"". Well, at least the chorus. It's annoying, but mitigated by the fact that you have to initiate the quacking by triggering it. Which she delights in doing repeatedly. Especially once she knows that I'm not a big fan. Ever the tease, she just can't help herself!

The kids love it. So during the winter (not just the Christmas season to my chagrin), it takes up permanent residency on the loveseat in our living room.

And then the thing starts to take on a life of its own. Suddenly one day while I am seated on the sofa next to the loveseat sorting through today's mail, it starts to quack without being invited. Just out of the blue. ""Quack-Quack-Quack"". ""Jingle Bells"" in January.

Beautiful Wife is just coming down the hall at this moment: ""I thought you didn't like him?""

Me: ""I don't. It just started up on its own.""

Beautiful Wife laughs: ""Sure it did, Sweetie.""

Me: ""It did!""

And then as if to prove a point, it did it again: ""Quack-Quack-Quack"".

Beautiful Wife is genuinely surprised: ""Well, I guess it did then.""

From then on, it randomly and sporadically starts to sing at unexpected moments. But my wife and kids notice that it only seems to do it when I'm around. I think they are kidding me, and just say ""Good one."" They weren't kidding me.

Finally comes the day that winter decorations give way to spring, and I happily place my wife's toy duck in the storage box with other decorations. These go into the shelves in the laundry room - about one quarter of the basement in this house is laundry room and storage.

And now every now and then when I'm in that room, I can hear it quacking at me again from within that box. I point this out to my Beautiful Wife. She laughs and says I'm paranoid. She never hears it, and she spends a lot more time in the laundry room than I do. Then one day when we are both in there, it sings again.

Beautiful Wife: ""Well what do you know. Never heard it do that before!""

Then the year turns and once again the Christmas decorations are put on display. Again, to my dismay, the hated duck is given its spot on the loveseat. And now practically every time I enter the room, it sings at me. Again, the wife and kids tell me it only does this around me. Again, I believe them to be joking.

Come Christmas day, one of the kid's new toys needs a couple double-AA batteries. With a wicked smile that even the Grinch would have given props to, I steal the batteries from the evil duck. Beautiful Wife cannot protest too much. She'll just get new ones for it tomorrow when the stores are opened again.

Cue the next day when I come in with the mail and the foul fowl starts its cheery song at me. I find my wife in our bedroom. She's drinking hot chocolate and watching ""Gone with the Wind"". She watches it every Christmas, and often a few more times during the days after. It's her thing.

Me: ""I see you didn't waste any time at all getting batteries for your evil duck.""

Beautiful Wife: ""Um... I haven't really been able to get to that. Why?""

Me: ""It's singing at me again.""

We go and investigate: there are no batteries in it. In fact, one of the wires to the battery pack case is broken. She accuses me of breaking it on purpose to silence him. I protest, but only end up sounding more guilty. It doesn't sing. Pressing the wing and the tongue does nothing.

But if I walk into the room and no one else is there, it starts up again. Singing its happy, irritating tune.

It will be two more years until Beautiful Wife actually hears it doing this. She's perplexed, but cannot get past how cute and cartoonish this duck is. This doesn't creep her out at all. She likes that it bothers me. It remains enthroned in the Loveseat.

We live in this same house for years. At a certain point, the creepy evil duck is no longer stored, but remains in its place in the living room. It still quacks at me. It still has no power source. I hate it.

When we move, it moves with us. We only live a year in that house before moving into a much smaller place. To my relief, the duck goes into deep storage in a storage unit. Where it remains until this day. I've thought of secretly discarding it. But she has made me promise to do no such thing.

But every now and again when I am looking for something in our storage unit, I hear quacking coming from a box deep in the back.

I had no paranormal experiences in my childhood and I would not consider myself psychically gifted.

&amp;#x200B;

However, my attitude changed during Corona. 2019 has been a very difficult year for me. I had hoped that things would get better in 2020 and pushed myself through the year with all my might. And then the pandemic came. I remember realizing that I just couldn't do it anymore because I didn't have enough strength.

&amp;#x200B;

And then this ""presence"" entered my life. I could feel that sometimes someone was there to stand by my side. I was also able to communicate with this ""spirit"". When I was feeling bad, he was there. 

&amp;#x200B;

This spirit also helped me in terms of personal growth and more than once gave me a push in the right direction. Since I never really had anyone to really take care of me (my parents hardly had time for me since I grew up with a brother with health issues) I found it great to finally have a mentor of sorts. Even though I couldn't see my mentor.

However, I had learned early on that there was no such thing as ""free lunch."" I began to wonder what the spirit had to gain from helping me. I got a name and a face to the spirit. But it is not someone related to me. However, I have read on the Internet about similar experiences with this ""person"". Partly the things corresponded 1:1 to what happened to me (first contact and the like).  I even once stumbled across a pop song dedicated to this person and I found myself in the lyrics. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then I found Reddit and this thread. I read a few stories and kept coming across warnings about demons. And honestly, it scares me.

The following story is true and my own, anything that is speculation on my part will be made clear .I apologize in advance, this will be rather long and will not have a TL:DR at the end, may be poorly written and will switch between a professional and informal style of writing. Note: this is from my memory alone and some details may be slightly incorrect and I certainly won't remember everything and my sense of time is nonexistent.  
Please ask any questions you want that may help, I'll answer as best I can.

So to set this up, this happened 11/15-17/2021 involving myself, 2 of my friends who I am no longer in contact with, Luna and her husband W. (names have been altered) Me and my mom live in the same house the southeastern US, Luna is in the northeastern US and W is in the northwestern US (currently in the army, hence the separation).

I met Luna and W in mid/late October on a videogame (Phasmophobia) and quickly became close friends with both and the 3 of us would fall asleep in voice/video calls on discord every night and would frequently be in a call for 72 hours straight.

Relevant to this story, Luna is (apparently) some sort of (baby) witch and has the ability to sense spirits and they will sometimes communicate with her. I have had a couple of ""weird"" occurrences and up until this point was mostly skeptical of the paranormal, but open to the idea and enjoyed ghost stories and the like.

I'll also take the time to explain the layout of my bedroom (where almost all of this takes place).I live in a single story farmhouse in basically the country version of a suburb and my bedroom is at the front left (looking from the street) corner, there are 2 exterior walls, both have windows, one is facing the street through the porch and the bottom is about 2 feet from the ground, the other is facing to the right (looking from inside my room facing the street)  and is about 6 foot from the ground and has an AC unit in it.  Inside my room my bed is set against the interior wall opposite the non-street window facing the street window with the door and nightstand to my 6 o'clock and bookcase to my 12 with the front window to my 1 o'clock. I keep my phone attached to the bedframe (metal bed) on my left while I sleep with a belt clip and I have a cable run beside my bed tied to the frame so I can charge it (I have cats  so I can't lay it down and the only plugs are on the other side of the bed from my nightstand)

So it was about 02:20 on the 15th. Me, Luna and W were in a video call, W and Luna were already asleep, W had muted/deafened ( I don't remember which or why) and I was facing away from my phone about to fall asleep (I was in the state where you're not sure if you're awake or not) and I don't remember if Luna said something or if I just sensed something was wrong, but I woke up in a snap and knew something was really wrong and within a half second I went from almost asleep and facing away from my phone to facing it and was fully awake and ready to stomp a mudhole in somebody. As soon as I turned over I asked Luna ""What's wrong?"", she was sitting up in her bed highly distressed and it took about 30 seconds to a minute for her to calm down enough to answer.

She explained to me that she had a dream where she was working at a burger joint and it burned down (iirc she wasn't inside when the fire started)  and after the fire had been put out she was standing in the wreckage looking at something odd when she saw a man in an alley beside her and she called him over ""Sir can you come over here to look at this?"" and as he walked over she realized he wasn't human. He was tall and covered in burned/rotten flesh with piecing red eyes, as he got within a couple feet of her she realized she was frozen in place and that this part wasn't really a dream. He stopped and started to speak in Latin to/at her and as he did so she felt a burning pain start in her armpit and begin to move towards her heart and she began saying ""WAKE UP"" to herself, by the 3rd time she said it he finished speaking and she woke up (neither of us were sure if she said ""WAKE UP"" out loud or not.

As she was telling this to me I felt a chill begin on my arms when she described the entity (she said it was a demon) that was unlike any chill I've had before. It felt exactly as if my arms were covered in a sheet of ice (not hyperbole, I mean that exact feeling of ice on your skin) and at some points it would expand into my chest and sometimes all the way to my toes but never up my neck (rubbing my arms did nothing to warm them and they felt normal temp)  and I began to feel a sense of severe fear. Either before she told me this/while/after we decided that we weren't going back to sleep and she got on her computer and I grabbed my laptop and got on the call there (we have different pc/phone accounts to we can join the same call with both and have our phones act as webcams since neither of us have one.) She also told me she could tell the demon from the dream was outside her window. When she told me that my fear started to be accompanied by anger (I am highly protective of those that I care about and there isn't a damn thing that can make me back down when someone I care about is threatened while at the same time I don't care what happens to me).

By this point it's about 02:50-03:15 and as we're talking I no longer feel alone and start spinning my head around (less in fear, more in an angry ""where are you, you sumbitch?!"" way) scanning my room, I asked Luna if she felt anything around me and didn't but I knew that I was not alone and was being watched and she no longer felt the demon near her. After a couple minutes of this happening and my eyes being drawn to a spot about 6 inches left of my window I realized and stated ""It's outside my window"" and it felt like I locked eyes with it. It dawned on her that I was right and I felt a level of sheer terror that I have never even come close to in my 18 years of existence, but at the same time fleeing/hiding never even entered my mind as it felt clear to me and I still have no idea why or how that if I did it would be able to attack her (I have no clue if that's true but anyhow).I did the only thing that came to my mind and that was to stare and growl at the demon (I may have also flipped it the bird...).I could tell that whatever was outside my window, and there was something there and wasn't just my imagination, was evil, angry and wanted to do me severe physical harm if not just straight up kill me.

So this goes on for the next half hour or so, with it alternating between my house and hers. I asked her why the fuck it was outside my house if it was targeting her, she told me and I have no clue if this is true or just bull, that I'm a ""protector"", she explained it but idk if it's at all true. By this time it's about 04:00 and one of my European friends asks why I'm still awake and I tell him to get in the call and we explain the situation to him and he believes us. Me and Luna then get on a game to try and distract ourselves a bit from the situation and play until about 05:30 or so, by this point we both feel safe and neither of us feel the demon nearby and I decide to go to sleep, leaving her awake.

At 08:00 my alarm goes off for me to feed my dogs, which I do, then I go back to sleep until about 13:00 iirc, at which point I get up and go out to my living room (note I'm still in a call with Luna, W had the situation explained to him earlier and had to leave the call for work) and my mom asks how I slept and I explained that I didn't and we told her the story and she believed us, I don't remember her exact reaction but she was not happy about the situation and wanted to know why there was a demon outside my window last night (question we all wanted answered).

My mon had to go to town for some stuff and that left me at home in a call with Luna so I went out to the porch and started to look around the window to see if anything had been disturbed and nothing had. I told Luna this and she told me ""I don't know why, but you'll find something within 6 feet of the window."" I look around and find jack, she tells me ""I know you'll find something and I feel 6 feet away, is there a wall or anything like that nearby?"" and I realize, my porch is fenced in for my dogs to be let out and the front of the porch is blocked by lattice and on the other side of said lattice is a fern bed that is about 6 feet deep. I go on the other side of the fern bed and start looking and right in front of my window there are 2 massive footprints (I'd say about a size 15 boot would be needed to make those) at the edge of the fern bed that weren't there the day before, but they weren't normal, they dented into the grass/ferns up like someone was standing there, but they didn't go all the way to the ground, there was about a half inch to an inch of grass to the ground, it was like whatever left them was levitating ever so slightly and there were no prints leading to those 2. I took a picture but it doesn't really show anything  well, if anyone asks I'll provide an imgur link.  


Me and W both have a rather similar feeling about this ordeal and have a rather fearless attitude of ""Is this really the best you can do?"" and are essentially laughing in dangers face causing Luna to think we're both crazy (she may have a point).

So later that day, about 15:00, I'm talking to Luna and I get this sense of fear, the same chills as the previous night and my heart is pounding, but it's not beating fast (about 60 bpm, previous night highest I was aware of was about 120 bpm) just hard, **really** hard, each beat is painfully hard and I find out later that W is having this exact same thing happen at the exact same time, keep in mind we have no idea about the other and describe the exact same thing. Luna explains the demon is probably trying to attack her but can't because of me, causing what I'm feeling (same for W) (pure speculation), this goes away after about 45 minutes.  


The rest of the day is uneventful until W gets off work at about 16:00-17:00 and we all talk about what happened, this goes on for a couple hours. Luna is exhausted and goes to sleep by 19:00, me and W just mute and do our separate things until he falls asleep sometime around 21:00. Sometime between 22:00 and 23:00 I have some stinging spots appear on my arm without cause, they're very similar to a 1st degree chemical burn, they're on the inside top of my left wrist just down from my watch and appear as if someone was tapping my arm with the tip of their finger leaving a mark where they touch. The marks appear and are gone within a span of 15-20 minutes at the most.  


I end up falling asleep about 23:00 and wake up at about 02:30 due to Luna and W being awake and talking, I ask what's up and they explain the demon tried to attack Luna, waking W up and for some reason I felt nothing until they told me at which point I felt the same fear/chill/heartbeat combination I had earlier that day. This continues until about 02:50 at which point all 3 of us go back to sleep.  


I don't recall what time I woke up on the 16th but it was before noon.  
The early day goes uneventfully until the afternoon, where I have the same reasonless chemical burn, but this time on the ring toe of my right foot, like someone drug their finger on it leaving a mark that also comes and goes within 15 minutes, this time I'm able to tell Luna but I don't remember her response and I was able to take a picture of this (I'll post it on imgur if desired).  


Luna does some witchcraft stuff for protection (I have no clue about any of the hocus pocus bs and if it's real) for herself, W and me.  
Later that day me and my mom had a concert to go to so I left the call with Luna and W, everything's fine, I get home from the concert at about 11:00, join the call, W is already asleep and Luna is about to be. I get in bed and I'm laying there on my pc for about 30 minutes and have the chemical burn, but this time on the right side of my throat in the exact position and shape as if someone is trying to choke me, and after they fully appear if feels like someone is lightly pushing into my windpipe like someone is trying to choke me, causing to to grab at my throat and get a little pissed off. This disappears in guess what, 15 minutes or so (picture also available) and this is the last odd thing to occur during this whole thing.  


From here it is all speculation and I have no clue about the validity of any of this I want to make clear.  
Luna and W theorize that W's sister (who hates W and Luna, and is also a witch, supposedly) put a hex on Luna (she was basically having symptoms of CO2 poisoning but they put up a CO2 detector in that room and it wasn't it, that stopped as soon as she did the protection hocus pocus bs) causing this entity to attack her.  


A few days after this situation I cut communication with Luna and W (personal falling out that I'm not going to get into) so I have no Idea what's happened on their end.  
All I've experienced since has been occasionally feeling uncomfortable like I'm being watched with no explanation.

One night i dreamed about going on a roadtrip. In that dream, i was in a car looking outside the window, i saw a black figure behind the bush   appearing and disappearing as the car moves. We stop by the gas station but i could still see the black figure staring at me. The feeling was creepy and it gave me chills down my spine. As the car started to move again, i turned around and saw the black figure right behind us. I was spooked.

I suddenly woke up in cold sweats and my body was numb. As soon as i touch the blanket i felt uneasy. I could feel eyes on me. I slowly look down towards the bottom of the bed. The black figure i saw in my dream was on the foot of my bed. I tried to scream but my voice was stuck in my throat. I was too scared so i slowly pulled up the blanket over me while crying. I covered myself, i dare not move. After a while i heard the footstep, from the bottom of the bed , it slowly go towards the door. 

As soon as the footstep left the door, i heard my brother called out my name. He asked where i was going. My mom probably woke up because he was shouting loudly. He asked what he was doing. He said ,"" I saw sister coming out of her room  slowly walking straight to the bathroom, I called her out but she didn't answered"".
At this point i was terrified and started crying loudly. My legs were all numb because i was on my bed and what my brother saw was the black figure and not me. My mom called out my name.  I gathered all my strength, shut my eyes and started running towards their bed.

My brother started shaking and crying when he saw me. He told my mom that he clearly saw me entering the bathroom and me coming out of my bedroom was impossible. We both cried loudly. Dad went to check the bathroom but nothing was there. Till this day, we don't know what it was but we remembered vividly what we saw that night .

I always thought that I believed in these kind of things, but now that it's happened to me, I'm trying my hardest to rationalize what I saw. Unfortunately, I can't.


I just want to start off by saying I am 37 years old and I have never experienced anything like this in my life and I hope to never experience it again. This happened three days ago.


It was 11:30 at night and I was taking my dog out to go to the bathroom. My boyfriend and I live on about four acres of land. We have an overgrown field in the distance. It's somewhat near the house, but not super close. I was carrying one of those spotlight flashlights. It's so powerful that you can see the beam shoot through the night's sky. My dog and I were getting close to the field so I decided to scan it with the flashlight. What I saw next terrified me.

I saw this creature walking through the field. It had a human shaped head, but the eyes were nothing like I had ever seen. They were so big that it took up a majority of its face. They glowed in a way that I had never seen. It was a piercing glow. I know that flashlights can create a certain type of reflective glow, but this was different. It was almost like the light was shooting out of its eyes. I live in a wooded area so I have come into contact with many animals at night. This was not the eyes of any animal I have seen.


It's weird because I don't recall seeing a mouth, but that could be because I was so fixated on it's abnormally large eyes that I wasn't paying attention to its lower face. Its eyes had this shocked, but evil look to them. That expression really stood out to me because it was so eerie. 


Now let's get to the body. It was somewhat human shaped, but it had abnormally long extremities. Even though the overgrown field covered some of its body, I could still tell the shape of it. The arms were too long for its body. I checked out how tall the overgrown grass was the next day and I estimated that the creature was about 6 ft tall.


The way it walked terrified me. It was facing me and walking sideways while staring at me. I have to admit I got so scared that I lowered the flashlight to the ground, but then I got enough nerve to raise it back up after a few seconds. It had made its way down the field a little bit more, but it was still walking sideways and staring at me with those horrifying eyes.

I started looking around and I saw in the distance ,two lights looking like a flashlight moving very fast and the light coming from them was very bright.  I was about a 100 feet away from this thing and I was on a cliff and the thing was down on the actual beach. 

I thought it was a person drowning and I was ready to call 911 until I saw the “flashlight” dipping in the water and kind of swimming around which looked very unrealistic but I don’t know how to describe it. It was as if an animal with very bright eyes was drinking from the ocean. But what animal has such bright eyes and screams for help?

Then I kinda connected the dots and I realized it’s a creature known as “night watcher” or “shadow watcher” that is known for hiding in the shadows of the night In California, usually near the ocean ,that kills people that go close to it, and then screams its victims’ last words out loud for easier tactic to catch its next victim.

I’m hoping someone can shine some insight on what this means and what I can do.

TL,DR: On 2 different occasions, I’ve been awoken to 2 knocks and then shortly after discover the word death written in fog on my back sliding glass door.

I live in a small apartment on the 2nd floor. I have a balcony with no fire escape. If you I wanted to get to my balcony from the street, you’d either need to have a ladder or be Spider-Man. In winter, if I shower for long enough with the bathroom door open, it will fog up my back sliding glass door that leads to the balcony. Admittedly, I only clean the windows like once a year, so you can imagine the handprints and whatnot that will accumulate on the glass. 

A few months ago, it’s late at night and as I’m falling asleep I hear 2 sharp knocks at my back glass door. Again, this balcony is not accessible from the outside so I’m spooked. I get up and check, no one outside. I chalk it up to exploding head syndrome and go back to sleep. Several days later, I get out of the shower, and through the handprints, it looks like the word “death” is written. My boyfriend disagrees, says it’s not clear enough. I question some of our friends who’ve been in the apartment in the last year and all of them deny they’d ever do such a thing. I clean the window and move on. Moving forward, I steam up the glass again and don’t see anything.

Last week, it’s early in the morning, and two knocks wake me again. This time I assume it’s my upstairs neighbor, but of course, I have an eerie feeling from the last time. Yesterday, I step out of a long shower, and clear as day, the word “death” is written on the back glass. You can quite literally see the swipe marks where I had cleaned over where it was written, so there’s no way I missed it the first time. I also compared to the original picture and it’s in a different spot. My boyfriend also agreed this time it was obviously the word death. 

No one except my boyfriend has been in the apartment, and this would be insanely out of character for him. I called my apartment complex and they denied maintenance entering my unit, claimed it was probably a previous tenant. I also have an alarm system, so it’s doubtful someone broke in. I cleaned the glass again and maintenance will be coming out to clean my glass with an industrial cleaner. 

As precautionary measures, I have set up a camera and 24/7 monitoring because my first worry is that someone is breaking in.

I tried searching the web and can’t find anything on this. I’m not sure if there is a correlation between the knocks and the word appearing, but I found the connection odd. I live in a fairly new building, built in 2016. The person who lived here before me was a college student. I haven’t had any issues the 2+ years I’ve lived here. I did start to get a weird vibe in 2020 but I chalked it up to the pandemic and spending so much time at home. Now that this is happening I don’t know where to start.

Before I get into my story I want to preface by saying that I 100% believe in the paranormal and think that it’s definitely what’s going on here. My question is why it’s happening. I’m only 20 years old, still live at home. My family built this house 15 years ago, the first and only family to live in it, so nobody has died within the physical house ever. We do live in the Midwest, so that may say something about the land that the house is built on, but I honestly couldn’t say.

Pretty much ever since I was a kid and we moved into the house I have experienced strange occurrences that I can only attribute to being paranormal. My older brother recalls a couple experiences of his own but we’re the only two in the house that seriously believe that they are paranormal occurrences. The earliest I can remember was in the late 2000s waking up in the middle of the night seeing what looked like Aztec warriors doing some sort of dance at the end of my bed. I wouldn’t say it was sleep paralysis because I could sit up and move my arms and legs. This went on for about 15-20 seconds before I blinked and they were suddenly gone.

When I moved into another room on the ground floor there were multiple times I would wake up in the middle of the night to hearing harmonica music coming from the living room. On one occasion when I heard the music I went out to see what it was and found every light in the house was turned on. On this occasion my brother also remembers waking up face down on the floor in his room in a “plank” position, with the lights on, with no memory of getting down there.

My latest encounter I was working on our computer in the downstairs living room (I was home alone at the time, rest of the family was out of town) when I heard the door to our stairs to go upstairs shut. It startled me obviously, knowing I’m supposed to be alone, so I just called out “who did that?” After a couple of seconds a weird airy voice that sounded like it was coming from all around me said “I did.” That was the first time I had actually had two way contact with whatever was messing around in the house, and being alone that night I went and stayed at a friends house.

A little while ago I got a call from my brother who was alone at the house saying that he was laying in bed in his room watching TV, with the door just barely cracked open. He said that he heard tapping on the door and turned to see fingers tapping on the inside of the door, as if someone was hiding on the other side grabbing the side of the door with their hand. When he got up to open the door to see who was doing it, the hand disappeared back outside of his room and he couldn’t find anyone or anything in the house.

We are honestly at a loss. Usually with stuff like this there is a pattern to the behavior, where it happens, what happens, but we have witnessed just seems like the most random junk and for absolutely no reason.

Both of us are believers in the paranormal, but also try to find a scientific and logical answer of what we’ve experienced before jumping to a paranormal explanation. However, neither of us were able to reach a logical conclusion on what I am about to describe.

Firstly, a bit of backstory: The house I grew up in was in a neighbourhood almost surrounded by forest and greenery. While that sounds like it would be tranquil to be around, it was not. Myself and other friends of mine have felt very uneasy walking through those woods even in the daytime, and not just the usual “I feel like someone’s following me”. It felt like someone was watching you from the second you stepped into the woods.

My house was on a street extremely close to the forest, it was about a 2 minute walk from my house to the main trail. Off the main trail, you were immediately met by thick forest, there were few small clearings before the huge open field behind the forest itself so it would take a long time to fight your way through the large forest before getting there. Very few people would make the trek out there so I could always almost guarantee that every time I went out there I would be able to enjoy the nature in serene isolation. 

In the warmer months of the year I liked to spend my free time walking through the forest, especially in fall when the leaves had all turned orange and red just before they would start to fall from the trees. This story takes place on one of those fall days. 

I had been walking through the forest listening to music with my earbuds in for at least couple hours. The last time I had ran into anyone else was around an hour ago, as per usual for my walks. Even though I knew I was probably very alone apart from various wildlife, I remember still not being able to shake the feeling that someone was very close to me. The sun was also setting so any sane person would be heading home by now anyways. After walking for a while longer, I decided to eventually start heading back in the direction of the main trail. By this time that the sun was just barely out. I had almost made it to a pretty nice clearing, but there was no way in hell I was going to go there only to have to walk home in the dark in the forest for hours especially since I was already very unsettled.

As I turned around to head back towards home, I heard a voice muffled by the music playing in earbuds come from behind me. I had been in very deep thought for a few minutes so I was a bit startled, but assumed I had accidentally spoken out loud to myself. Before I could even take a couple steps further I heard someone speak again. Fully aware of my surroundings now I froze dead in my tracks, my heart pounding as I took my right earbud out and sharply turned around to see who was behind me. I was horrified to see a person standing with their back towards me looking off in the distance. 
Everything about them looked so familiar and it took me a couple seconds to come to the horrifying realization that I was staring into the back of myself. It was wearing my dark navy and white plaid jacket, the black hood of the very hoodie I was wearing resting on the collar of my jacket. Even my same short blond unkempt hair with it’s brassy undertones shining in the last bit of light left from the setting sun.

And then it spoke again, “It’s not too far ahead now” in my voice. My exact voice: cadence, tone, everything. It took me a second to snap out of the paralyzing fear I was in and book it home. I didn’t try to speak to whatever it was, I just ran as fast as I could to the main trail and out of the forest. As I ran I could have sworn I had heard someone chasing me the whole way out of the forest (which might have just been a product of being hyper-aware of my surroundings in my state of fear), but I didn’t dare look behind me because I was terrified of what I might’ve seen when I looked behind my shoulder to check.

After nearly tripping on fallen branches and stumps a million times, I tore out of the forest and onto the road adjacent to my street. I kept running until I was on the complete opposite side of the road from the edge of the forest. I turned around and the only thing I saw were the bushes and branches I pushed through on my way out springing back into their natural place. I stood there staring at the forest for a minute before heading home in fear whatever that was would pop out, but saw nothing. I didn’t go back into the woods for some time after that, and almost every returning visit I brought a friend with me.

My friend told me she also had odd experiences in those woods and so had her sister. They had both seen tall, dark figures standing in the woods when they took walks through the forest together. One of them would see the figure, say nothing about it to the other and then book it out of the forest together. I’d seen similar figures, but had written it off as me seeing shadows from bigger trees, my mind playing tricks on me, etc.
I’d blocked this out of my memory for a long time until my friend had brought up her strange experiences in the forest and how she constantly felt uneasy in it. Still to this day years later I cannot come up with a rational or scientific explanation for what I saw and have had little luck looking online for answers too.

We live in the US and have been living at this house for about 13 years. For a few years we would hear really small children giggling and talking, playing music and dancing downstairs, playing basketball outside or jumping around in the trees. What I mean by really small children is that the steps sounded like tiny foot steps and the voices sounded like small kids with really high pitched voices. We didn't get pranked much other than things going missing only to find them a few days later and weird places, like a spatula under a couch, a cup behind the toilet, xxxx large underwear in the dryer mixed with our clothing... the largest underwear anyone in this house wears is medium, but other times we would find big dollar bills in our clothing like 20's, 50, 100. Sometimes we would find half of a gold chain, colorful stones and crystals or diamond rings, which is weird because no one in the house wears expensive jewelry.

I read once that leaving an offering for them would either bring better friendship or good luck from them or a very low chance of insulting them with a gift, causing them to leave. I left them a piece of cake once. The cake was gone but we never heard them again. At times we would still find things but things wouldn't go missing anymore. 3 years since I left them cake, my uncles are now visiting from Mexico since last week and just last night my parents and I heard them outside and downstairs. They were talking and laughing. From their tone of voice, it didn't sound like they were trying to scare or plan but more of just a friendly conversation. At one point I did pause my music while in my room because I heard weird children voices downstairs, thinking either someone in the house was watching TV or my brother and his son were playing, but no one in the house is ever up after 12am besides my parents and I, and my parents were in the complete opposite direction of the voices. But when I paused my music, I would hear one shushing the others and after a short pause, they would begin to whisper. Even rn that I am home alone, I don't feel any dark presence and we never did with them. More like they just wanted to be playful and curious. I just noticed the 3 Santa figurines that my mom got a few days ago which she placed on the table, and looking at them, it almost feels like they are the ones from last night.

Honestly, I would like to talk to them, try to make a friendship and welcome them to the home, as my parents would. My family and I have always loved listening to them talk and play. What should I know about them, what should I do or NOT do?

I’m new here and I would love an opinion about a video I captured six years ago. 

A bit of backstory: My family and I purchased a 12 acre farm in 2015. We bought it from a lady who was selling it as part of her parent’s estate, and they had owned it for about 60 years. 

She was a bit eccentric, and we were able to buy the property after she vetted us and let us make an offer. I think she was trying to protect it, and I understand why because it’s more of a park than a farm property. 

There is a massive cedar tree that’s somewhere in the middle of the property. She showed us the tree and said she has placed something under it for her parents. There was a pile of rocks there and a little plaque. 

My son was 12 at the time, and he was intrigued by the pile of rocks. I always told him not to touch them, but one day a few days before Christmas he went out there with a friend and looked under the rocks. He found an old film canister, and he popped it open. He said a mist flew out, and so did a bunch of teeth. 

He ran inside and told me what he did, and I was very freaked out. I ran out there, re-buried everything, and apologized to the tree. Lol I’m not sure why I did that, but it felt like something I should do. 

Within a few weeks some odd things started happening. I would hear voices over my shoulder when I was outside or I would see things in the field. I believe in ghosts because I had a few experiences when growing up, so I wasn’t too surprised or scared. 

I have security cameras on the property, and after it snowed I decided to share a clip of my llamas running past the house. I posted it to FB and didn’t think anything of it until someone asked me if I knew why the llama stopped so abruptly. I did not, so I watched it again and saw what she meant. There is something in the video, but I’m still not sure what.  

The video was taken in my front yard looking toward my shed. I put it up on Youtube years ago but no one has really weighed in. I'd love to see what the community thinks it is.

I’m not really sure how I forgot this because it was absolutely terrifying to me. The details are a bit foggy and I know there’s more to it that I can’t quite remember, but I can remember the main details clear as day.

I was sleeping and woke up to a tapping on my door. Thinking it was my brother pulling a prank on me, I got up quietly and opened the door quickly to try to scare him. Immediately, I heard something with at least 4 legs scurry down the hall but didn’t see anything. Obviously I was shaken by this and tried to convince myself I was just tired and hearing things. 

I turned on my lights and stood in the middle of my room for a couple minutes. Then I heard the “creature” scurry back down the hall to my doorway and started tapping again, much faster this time. I was paralyzed in fear. I thought about screaming, but the ominous feeling from the “creature” told me that was a really bad idea. I felt like it would break down my door the instant I screamed. 

My parents’ room was just underneath mine so I just started stomping on the floor. My dad sprinted upstairs to see what was going on. I told him what happened and he said he even got the chills from it (he did not believe in anything paranormal or spiritual in any way).

I don’t remember exactly what made me remember this, but it shook me to my core that I could just forget something that intense, especially something so recent. 

I asked my dad earlier this year if he remembered that specific night. He told me there were so many times I came down to their room after seeing something in that neighborhood that he couldn’t remember.(Little backstory: we lived in two separate houses in the same neighborhood at different times from when I was 13 until I was 18) 

Apparently I had dozens upon dozens of paranormal experiences in these houses. I don’t remember ANY others than the one I just described to you. In fact, I remember not believing in anything paranormal until recently, despite having these experiences throughout middle and high school. It’s almost like I had a completely fragmented memory while we lived in this neighborhood.

I was earring sound that at first sounded like the TV in the background so I did not pay attention to it but after a couples minutes the sounds started to get weirder like deep men voice talking gibberish, the sound was a bit glitchy could not understand words. So I asked them where was that coming from and if they could turn it down a bit. They told me there was no Tv on and they in fact did not have a TV at their place, and thatthey where completely alone. They told me they could close the windows but the sound coming from the windows would be cars and they did not hear anything resembling what I described, they did and I still heard the voice, 
So I sent them a video of what I was hearing and they told me they had no idea where this sound is coming from as they cannot hear it irl.
The voice continued to appear repeatedly during the call it was pretty loud almost as loud as their voices but really unclear when their voices where really clear. We had a test with one of my friend stepping 2meters away from the computer and talking normaly and I wouldn’t hear her so it cannot be a far away noise that they did not hear.
To clarify apartment was totally silent except for her and me talking, no one else was there, they did not hear the voice coming from their microphone at anytime it was just me earring it from my computer coming from their microphone.

Here is a link of an extract where you can hear the voice the voice start at 0:10 sec the beginning is just my classmate singing and talking.

A while later some really freaking scary music starts playing. I’m not easily scared but this legit made me freaked out and it was like slow but kind of high pitched I think and I am atm trying to find the song but to no avail. Anyways this song kept playing on repeat for hours. And when I was gonna head to bed he woke up but suddenly the music had stopped. 

I talked to him today he doesn’t remember anything after he fell asleep. And I explained to him about the scary music that played but he doesn’t believe me because he said his phone was on his desk charging when he fell asleep. And he showed me his YouTube watch history and there is so song there at all. Just the video he fell asleep to and the video he was watching as he woke up. I am really freaked out still because I don’t know what’s going on rn. He said it may have come from outside but all windows and our balcony was closed the whole time

We have been pretty dead tonight due to a thick fog so I went out to check the parking lot and get a bit of fresh air. As I was getting ready to go back in I looked out to the Roundabout I saw some one standing in the center piece of the roundabout staring up the road to a neighboring town. I thought this was odd as it's like 2 AM and Foggier then silent hill out side so I called out to the person to see if they were in trouble but got no response. I then looked at my phone for like half a second and when I looked up they were just gone.

This kinda weirded me out a bit as there is no way they could just disappear at that point as even with the fog I could make out the body and clothes but looking back on it I never did see a face.

Just last summer we had a accident where a trucker lost control of his rig and came barreling down the same road the figure was staring at and ended up killing a 2 people in car on the roundabout so I'm wondering if there is a connection there.

I’m not a member of this sub, I’m pretty sensitive to creepy things yet I’m a skeptic. I don’t think I am after tonight and I’m trying to make sense of what just happened. 

I have a cat with kidney disease, and when I got home tonight she took a turn for the worst. Me and my girlfriend were stunned and not sure what to do and to be honest I didn’t think she was going to pass. Any emergency vet is extremely hard to contact this late, my best bet was wait until morning. Last time it took a few hours to even get connected to someone at all (just for them to tell me that they couldn’t help until the next day). I say my goodbyes because it’s becoming abundantly clear to me that something is happening. When my girlfriend comes back to the room we felt an energy that’s so hard to describe it felt like white noise but overwhelmingly loud. We start crying and right as we start touching hands she has a seizure. We had her in a box with blankets to keep her comfortable until we could take her somewhere, and as she’s having this seizure her body kind of curls backwards against the corner of the box. She’s making awful noises and I know what’s happening and as it stops, our LEDs turn off (they had been lightly flickering while this was happening). We talk to each other about how weird that is and we’re kind of freaking out, but we hear her gasp for air and snap back into it to support her. It happens again slightly, nothing terrible but right as we tell each other “she’s gone” everything turns off. Every single thing in our house is just… off. And this happened less than an hour ago so it’s still very new but our power is still off, the bar next to our house has no power, and there’s NO lights at the gas station across the street. I would think it’s a coincidence but the energy I felt was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. This was a special cat. I can’t explain her presence to someone who didn’t know her. She was so much more than a pet, and everyone loved her. Whatever happened tonight is so confusing.

 then it was like a blanket of cold air covered my body starting from my  legs then to torso and head
(i wasnt under the duvet) 
As the cold air got to my torso i felt like quickly batting it with my arm but i was frozen it fear. 

As this cold air got to my head i heard this muffled sound in my right ear(i had earplugs in) it was sort of like a croaky gurgling noise, and then it was gone....and my body started to warm up. 
Then i opened my eyes as quick as i could and as wide as i could and i thought wtf was that! 

I then grabbed my husband and his arm cuddled me back and he told me he couldnt sleep. 
I then said.... Paul do you feel weird? And he said yes, i said '' did you feel like somthing was in the room with us''?.

Ok maybe not a billion, but definitely in the dozens. Recently I’ve been pretty free of ghostly and unexplainable stuff which has been great. 

But earlier this month I was in another city attending an outdoor event and I felt someone kind of quickly and eagerly tugging at my right arm. I turned assuming it was my friends and there was nowhere anywhere near me. There’s no way someone could have vanished that fast. 

Now I hate people tapping my arm. It’s one of the few things I just can’t stand. 

Anyway, I was bringing groceries into my house today and started talking to my nephew when I felt a really powerful tap on my left arm, almost like someone had bunched their fingers together and jammed them at me hard. I asked him if he saw anything and he said no. He’d been looking right at me.

So I went outside and looked at my garden, checking on my flowers. I feel the same strong tap on my left arm but even stronger.

I’ll explain some of the more jarring incidents, but there’s also been countless little things happen like things moving, random noises etc-

One morning I was getting ready for work, went to the bathroom and came back to my room minutes later. I have a storage tote by my bed that I use as a nightstand. Sitting on top of it were my keys, a folded shirt, and a rolling tray with baggies and rolling paper on that. When I entered my room I saw the lid of the tote flipped over onto the ground with everything that was on top of it underneath it, positioned exactly as it was when the lid was on the tote, not as if the lid was lifted and everything fell off in the process and scattered onto the floor. I know the lid was on just minutes ago because I woke up and grabbed my phone that was sitting on the tote. My roommate was in bed sleeping during this incident. This one freaked me out big time. 

I was sitting in my living room playing video games and saw a flash drive that was sitting on the TV stand just slowly move towards the edge and fall onto the ground. Roommate and I both saw that happen. That was significant because it was the first time we actually saw something move and didn’t just hear it from another room. 

My mirror broke by falling over on its own while it was propped up against a wall in my room, I never got around to throwing it away though. A few months later, one of the glass shards that was still glued to the frame was removed and fell to the floor, i didn’t see this happen but heard it from outside my room. 
I’ve also gone into my room and randomly found small mirror shards on the ground near my bed which is nowhere near where the mirror sits against the wall broken. 

I was hanging up clothes in my closet and felt something VERY cold come around my foot. It wasn’t a solid touch, it just felt like energy but also a very noticeably ice cold sensation. It was very sudden and scared the fuck out of me, this one sent me running straight out of my room. There were no drafts, door and window were closed and AC was off. 

A majority of the activity has happened in my room. I also suspect that this may be a poltergeist that is specifically attatched to me, because ever since moving into this apartment I’ve had a very unusual frequent bad luck, like just really out-of-the-blue bad things happen to me on an almost daily basis.

What it was? And i was hoping some of you knew.

A little backstory: i used to be into wiccan stuff, sometimes made good spells (dont know if they worked), i talked to angels (or tried to, i always used to get feathers in my room so i took that as a yes) and was an empath and could feel my own energy and how people around me felt. Then this event happened and I stopped the wiccan things completely. I have not taken them up again and its like i lost everything i felt that was connecting my soul to earth in a deep magical level, everything feels normal now.

Anyway, here it goes. I do not remember if it was the day before halloween or on halloween. But it was around that time. I had been lighting up my pumpkins and candles but was too tired to wait for midnight so i turned everything off and eventually fell asleep. I don’t remember how or when i passed out. 

The only thing i remember is feeling like it was raining on me, on top of my bed and i could see light through my eyelids. I remember wondering why i felt wet all over my body like it was raindrops. So i opened my eyes and i saw this huge hazy shimmery light in my ceiling, right on top of me. 

I was not scared at the time and i remember thinking and saying in my brain: what is this? And i heard a voice. A male voice. Not out loud, but inside my own brain. It was like communicating without speaking out loud. 

The voice said to me. Do not be scared, just close your eyes and go back to sleep. It felt soothing and i was not scared but i grabbed my phone and typed something on my notes cuz i wanted to know if it was real or if it was a dream. I could still feel it raining but there was no rain. 

So i closed my eyes and went back to sleep. I remember thinking do not open your eyes do not open your eyes till i passed out.

When i woke up the next morning, i checked my phone and it had the writing i had done, which meant it happened, that it was real. I suddenly felt a shiver down my back and i got so scared. I told my family and asked everyone who or what it was but they had no idea. 

Thats the day i stopped being wiccan and now i don’t do anything from any religion. But the experience still creeps me out, even just writing this at night.

So, does anyone know what it was? Who it was? Why the light was there? Why it felt like raining and raindrops? What it probably did? Was it bad or good? Does anyone have any idea?

They have two children, 2 and 5. 

The 5 year old has frequent nightmares and a tough time in general getting to sleep most nights. Tonight for example, he called down at least four times before this incident. I kept going upstairs to rub his back or read him “one last story” (isn’t it always the LAST book?). 

Maybe 5 minutes after my last trip up to give him another hug and a drink of water, my husband was looking for a game to play on my sisters new VR head set. This headset is brand new, and with just basic attachments and such. No headphones, so the sound comes out of the headset (or headband?) itself. I heard my nephew mumbling upstairs, I figured he was reading himself a story. Followed by what sounded like a low male’s voice speaking back to him. I first assumed it was the VR headset. Until my husband ripped it off his head with a “what the fuck was that?” I said I assumed it was his headset but I swore I heard my nephew talking and a man’s voice talking back. To which he replied “that’s exactly what I thought I heard.” He hadn’t even decided on a game for the headset, so no sound was coming out. 

He (begrudgingly) went upstairs to check on my nephew, who was sound asleep. A kid that was WIDE awake 5 minutes prior. I know kids crash hard, so I’m not too suspicious about that. But how do we explain the voice? We checked all doors and windows, everything is locked. We have 3 large dogs who are alert and LOVE a reason to bark, they’ve been calm all night. I called my sister to ask if they ever hear anything, which she replied with a quick no. But we are FREAKED out. How do we explain both hearing a very distinct low man’s voice upstairs what seemed like replying to my nephew? Their home is brand new, and in an upper class neighborhood (not that that matters much when it comes to the paranormal).

Kinda just looked at the ceiling for a min then turned my head toward the bedroom door. I could see the night light in my daughter's room slowly, softly change from one color to the next. It lit up the hallway. The phases from one color to the next lasted only a few seconds. Yellow, blue, green and then red. I always thought the red was a bit dark. A blood red. I watched it go thru the cycle a couple times. It turns red one last time. I don't think much of it until it doesn't change. It stays red. I think to myself wtf? But I just wait thinking eventually it'll change.  It doesn't. 

At this point enough time has passed I'm like ok wtf is going on. So I decided to go check it out. But I couldn't move. I was paralyzed.  It seemed like the more I struggled the harder it was to move. The panic started to creep in and with every second that passed the more panic I became. Then my daughter let out this horrible scream. The kinda scream you never want to hear. Let alone from your child. It's was horrifying.  I knew something terrible was happening to her. But the more I tried to move the harder it became. I was freaking out. 

It went silent. Still I'm struggling to get out of bed. A few seconds went by then another blood curdling scream. Suddenly I was released and sprang out of bed only to face plant on the ground. My legs didn't work. I couldn't feel my legs at all. But I had to save my daughter.  So butt ass naked I start low crawling to my daughters room. Ready to kill whatever was causing her harm. She let out one last scream as I approached the door to her room. I mustered the strength to stand up a flipped the lights on. 

WHAT!!!? WHATS GOING ON!!? ARE YOU OK!!? WHAT!!? she's in the corner of her room curled up, the look of pure fright on her face. She runs to me and jumped in my arms. That shit scared the hell outta me. Once she calmed down she told me she woke up and was just laying there watching her light change colors. Then it changed to red. And stopped. She started to get scared and was going to come to my room but then her bedroom door turned into a large mouth with sharp teeth and started coming toward her chomping up and down.

However i remember it very vividly and have always wondered what the heck I saw. 

Whenever I would wake up during the night and needed to drink water, I'd call for my mum as I was too scared to go downstairs by myself. She is a very light sleeper and would wake up and come to my room pretty quickly. One night I woke up and called for her, as always I saw the door open and saw her figure standing in the doorway. However she didn't speak or enter, just stood there watching me. This was odd because usually she'd come in asking what was wrong and sit next to me. So I asked her for water. She didnt respond but started moving towards me, still staring. It was dark in my room however the street lights outside illuminated inside just a bit so I could still make out the outline of things in my room.

Whatever this thing was looked exactly like her, I could see the outline of the robe she would always wear, her hair and arms. I could also feel her presence in the room, I was fully convinced it was her. As she was moving towards me I called to her again, ""Mum???"". I waited and she didn't respond just kept looking at me.

Then my real mum entered the room. I screamed when I realised the other being wasn't her. As soon as she entered it disappeared. My mum was so confused as I was frantically trying to explain that I saw something exactly like her.

After that experience the most common nightmare I'd have as a child/teenager was of the same situation. I'd be with a family member, then I'd glance at the hallway or a doorway and see a figure that looked exactly like that family member looking at me and smiling menacingly. Sometimes the dream would be worse where I'd be interacting with someone who appeared to be acting normally. Then they would start smiling oddly, staring at me and have weird erratic behaviour that was really unlike that person. Eventually I'd realise it wasn't really them, rather the being that keeps appearing to be the people I love. I know this will sound weird but I always felt like it was the same ""thing"" shifting to look like my family members, it gave off a unique energy.

I was picking up books and browsing through them when I got to a particular book. The book was big, not a regular normal sized book I usually see. It was black with gold writing on its cover and gold color pages. I did not touch the book because I felt I should not.

The book spoke to me, not in public but through my mind. It said , "" I know you want revenge and I can make them pay. Take me home with you and I'll show you.""
I felt in a daze after that but I quickly left that area and left the Library.  

About 3 days later, I was no where near the Library. The same voice came through my mind. It said, ""I'm waiting for you, go to the Library and take me to your home.""

So since a few months I see things in my house and I don‘t know what these things could be. Sometimes ist like a mixture between fog and veil, also it‘s always white. It’s slowly moving, but if I want to take a closer look it disappears.
Sometimes there are these super fast moving shiny things. They are silver and gold and look like a sparkler. (I hope thats the right word and you know what I mean)
Also I believe that my dogs see these things as well, today we instantly looked at the same time as it appeared in the kitchen. My boyfriend can‘t see these things and doesn‘t take it very serious 😅
A few minutes later I was showering and as I turn around, i see a picture on the foggy glass and it looks like a fairy or something. I swear it isn‘t something I’ve done! I took a photo of it, because I couldn‘t believe it. 
Everytime I see something it‘s in the kitchen, dining room, living room area which is practically an open space. 
Maybe it‘s important to say that it never feels scary or dangerous, I kind of feel joy when I see it. 
Also as I‘m writing this, I hope it doesn‘t feel calleed out or something to never appear again if that makes sense.

I have many of stories about the man I called “Robert”, but one thing that will always stay with me is when he would wake me up from nightmares. The summer my husband was deployed my nightmares became an every night thing. 

One night I was having a nightmare and the reason I woke up was because my bed had been shaken as if someone had kicked the side and the fire alarm went off one time. I remember waking up freaked out and trying to figure out why the alarm went off. And why it just beeped once and not again. 

The next day I called the maintenance over to check the alarms and was told everything was fine. This became an almost nightly occurrence. I would have a nightmare and be woken by 1 beep of the fire alarm. I feel like he was trying to watch over me and it brought me an odd sense of comfort. 

We moved in 2020 and after telling my new neighbor one night what happened, my husband opened up and told me the same happened to him. He said he was scared to tell me but on the nights I was not there he had nightmares and the alarm went off once. I had never told anyone until this night so we were shocked to know this happened to both of us. 

Am I crazy for thinking he was helping me?

  Throughout my childhood there were many things experienced by myself and other family members that we have been unable to explain such as glassware moving of its own accord, doors slamming when there’s only one person home and the voice of a small child behind the sofa. When I moved away in 2017 to a different town I had zero experiences like this and assumed whatever it was, it was attached to my family home. 
  Fast forward to last month (nov ‘21) and I’ve moved about 500 yards away from my parents, due to my mother undergoing cancer treatment.
    The reason I’m here in the group was an incident that occurred last night that  I cannot logically explain - I’m hoping someone here might have some insight. 
    I was trying to sleep, the lights were off and my eyes were closed although I wasn’t tired per-se, it was just late. As I went to roll over in bed someone (it felt human) grasped my forearm. I immediately opened my eyes but nothing was there. About twenty minutes later I felt something stroke the top of my head. 
   I live alone, and I certainly didn’t sleep after that as I was too freaked out. I don’t take any medication, I don’t drink, and I wasn’t in a dream state. I’m genuinely scared to be alone again tonight.

Last night at exactly 3:38am I woke up with the quietest scream I’ve ever produced. I didn’t even think I was capable of screaming so quietly. As soon as my eyes opened, I saw this like almost ball of black static floating over my husband. And as soon as he woke up, from me screaming, it dissipated.

I don't think I've ever been afraid of anything weird or unexplainable happening around me, because I figured that it could be a ghost or whatever. But yesterday I had the weirdest experience of my life and it left me terrified. 

So I'd had a pretty rough day, it was the last day or my college term and I had had someone follow me home. I was a bit spooked so my boyfriend came round since I was home alone with my dog. Anyways, we're playing with my dog and then I decide to work on my university application at the dining table.

My boyfriend starts to say he's going to go upstairs and snoop around for his Christmas presents, so I push the chair out and run after him, just as like a joke thing. My dog was stood at the bottom of the stairs (he's not allowed upstairs unless it's bed time) and waited for us. We start hearing him crying which is really unusual so we go downstairs immediately and comfort him. 

When we go back to the dining table my heart drops. My living room is open plan, it's a living and dining space with like a gap in between. In the gap there's a big side board unit that has pictures of my relatives, some passed on some still alive, and then I've just out one up of a baby scan of my niece or nephew. The room has a wood floor, and the chairs are pretty heavy.

When I go back into the room the chair I was sat on is right up again the unit, placed as if someone was sat on it and looking at the pictures. My boyfriend thought it could be when I stood up to take after him, but we tried it out and the chairs are so heavy it barely moved. We thought it could have been my dog but he's too small and we would have heard the noise of the chair against the floor.

(These stories are pretty short, sorry)

Experience 1: I stayed in the side rooms of the house that had 2 guest rooms, where I also had my PC. I can clearly remember while browsing on the internet, suddenly I hear a cough and a laugh come from one of the rooms. No one stayed in the side rooms besides me, and when I checked the room I heard the sounds come from, no one was there.

Experience 2: Sometimes while sitting out on the front porch, I would see a shadow figure out of the corner of my eye standing in the living room. Not sure if my eyes were playing tricks, or if something/someone was really there.

Experience 3: The side rooms I stayed in didn't have AC connected to it as it was built on when my great-grandparents had my grandpa and his siblings. During the winter I would bring in a heater and turn it on an hour or so before I would go sleep. Keep in mind this heater has 2 switches that needed to be on for the heater to do its thing. One night I turn the heater on and go back to watch TV. An hour or so later I headed to bed, but when I got to my room the heater was off. I'm positive this wasn't a malfunction as you had to actually push these switches to turn it off, and they were both in the off position.

Experience 4: I was in the living room watching TV, and decide to go to the kitchen to get a drink when a commercial break started. As I'm walking back to the living room, I hear 3 knocks on the door leading to the side room where I sleep. I open the door and turn the light on, nothing had fallen, was out of place, or near the door to cause any knocking.

Experience 5: This is by far the one experience that actually gave me a good spook. I had just laid down in bed and didn't have my AC that plugs in running. I could quite clearly hear someone at the foot of my bed walk from there, to the right side of the bed where I sleep on. The steps stopped next to me, then I feel pressure as if someone had sat down next to me.

It was closed before I was born so I never had heard of it. A friend on Instagram took a photo there and I knew immediately I wanted to go. I convinced the other two to go the next afternoon. The trip to get there was relatively long and we had the radio on. His car had a radio that displayed the name of the song and at one point when we were close to the place, though no song was playing, the radio was stuck on the word God. 
This was probably the first sign of trouble. 

We arrived at the asylums campus. It was a self sufficient community when it worked. Had power buildings, a rec center, dorm hall and classrooms. As stupid teenagers with cameras we wanted picture of the inside of these buildings so we ventured inside the first one we found. It was a dorm with long hallways. The building was really quiet inside. No wind or anything going on outside. We entered on the second floor out of 3. We walked down the trashed hallways and over the broken glasses checking out rooms. Above us we here shuffling and we assume there are other explorers in the building. So we head up stairs to say hello and there was no one there. The buildings echo like crazy so we would have either seen or heard them walking away. 

We continue onto other buildings and not much happens. We hear creaks and crackles but nothing sounded more than explainable. Until we got to the old powerhouse. It had cat walks the went the height of the building to a steel door onto a roof. We decided to go up them and although slightly unstable, not paranormal. We got to the top where the door was wide open and my boyfriend goes to walk out and the door slams shut. This door was steel and fairly heavy and there was nothing touching it. We had been standing still for a minute talking so it wasn’t the vibrations from us walking. We pull and pull on the door and it would not budge. Cousin is looking for a way out of a nearby window and before he attempts to climb out the door opens like nothing happened. This is where we should have decided to go home. 

The last building we visited was the hospital. It was a really long building and the only entrance that wasn’t boarded up beyond belief was a window to the basement. We squeezed through into the dark basement. Little bits of light were peaking in from the outside sun. We walked around and discovered the morgue. Aside from it being cold and feeling sad nothing happened down there. We head up stairs to this long yellow hallway. You could see straight across to the other side of the building to go upstairs.

Depending on which one of us tells this story, this part is a little different. All of us had different paranormal experiences at the same moment. for me I remember not hearing anything but a high pitched ping (like when a grenade goes off in a game too close to you). I looked down to the end of the hall at the archway leading to the stairs and I saw a silhouetted hand with elongated fingers gesturing me to come closer. So I walked toward it without a second thought. Mindlessly we had all separated from each other. Then a long bang rings through the halls. I turn around and see them mouthing to hide below a window because an op is outside looking in. We hide and then when the coast is clear we made the fastest beeline out of the building and back to the car. We drove home terrified.

My brother told me one time he thought a shadow was me sneaking up behind him but when he turned around to scare me back no one was there.

I have a story that I’ve debated on telling for the last 7 years or so. A series of strange things that happened to me while I was growing up. I’m not sure what finally pushed me to the point of telling it, but while on a walk on a local trail today, I finally felt the urge to share it. Apologies if it comes off a little jumbled, or if some things are out of order. I've done my best to organize it, but it's tough to really pinpoint certain things.

At the moment, I’ve just ordered some food, and I’m playing modded minecraft to pass the time and feel…happy, if you can call it that. This is a true story, and based on my memory to the best of my ability to remember it. I’ve had a handful of traumatic experiences, so my memory has some missing chunks, but it is what it is unfortunately.  If I remember anything else, or if anyone has any questions, please ask away. I’ll do my best to respond as I go. I just want to share my story and get all of this off my chest now. Maybe I’ll feel a little better.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I’m some 24 year old correctional officer who is probably dealing with depression and slowly developing an alcohol problem. Some of this stuff still crosses my mind sometimes and the feeling it gives me is a mixture of extreme sadness and frustration, but what can I do? I’m just some guy.

I guess I should also say, my name is Cody. 

To give some background, back when I was around 10 years old, in the midst of my parents getting a divorce, I basically lived my life playing Runescape and reading books. Things were bad, and we lived in the middle of nowhere in Missouri, so these were my only ways to escape my parents yelling and shouting at each other all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One of the book series I was really into was Harry Potter. While playing Runescape one night, grinding my Mining level, I see someone with the name Fawkes29. Being a 10 year old, I was like “AW YEAH SOMEONE THAT LIKES WHAT I LIKE”, so I abandoned the mine and started following them, trying to make a new friend.

This person was named Danni. I’m not using fake names, because it’s virtually impossible to find these people now. Believe me, I’ve tried desperately hard to. Danni was around 13 years old at this time based on what she was telling me. After about a week of occasionally catching each other online, she introduced me to her boyfriend, a guy she called Gabriel (Who I would later learn was actually named Andy). These two were neighbors, and claimed they lived in Georgia (Something else I’m also not entirely sure is true). 

From that point on, Andy and I almost instantly became best friends. He was 13 years old like Danni, but he and I basically kicked it off as bros almost immediately. It was like one of those situations where you meet somebody and your personalities just click, if that makes sense. So I spent the entire rest of that summer playing Runescape every day and talking to Danni and Andy. Looking back on it, with my parents still actively working on separating and still living in the same house, this was an amazing way for me to get away from all of that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After that summer was over, school was about to start up again, and I didn’t have time to play Runescape much anymore. The night of open house, my dad pulls me into our bathroom when nobody is around. He forces me to take my pants off, and…I get molested. Immediately after this, I try to tell my mom, but she is too stressed and busy, and doesn’t listen to me. I give up, and try to deal with this on my own. 

Around December, my dad suddenly walked out of the house and never came back. My mom was heartbroken, and we ended up abruptly moving to my aunt’s in a different part of Missouri for a while. During this time, I had to change schools twice, got bullied a ton, and ended up becoming a fat emo loser who would eat to cope with his emotions. 

After several months, we ended up moving to a small town in south-east Missouri, much closer to where my mom has family. I can’t say the name per the rules, but a small town that starts with the letter P, Missouri. We moved into a small house in the middle of nowhere once again, off of some gravel road. House was old, worn down, pretty sketchy. Had some neighbors probably a quarter mile down the road, but was overall pretty secluded. We were renting it because my family has always been dirt poor, and even with the help of my mom’s side, we were only barely making it.

So I spent the summer cooped up in my closet-sized bedroom, playing Fable 2 (still not sure how my mom managed to afford it for my birthday). Depression had hit me at this point because of my parents separating, and the constant bullying I was dealing with, but I hadn’t realized it yet. My mom and sisters were all dealing with their own shit, so nobody really noticed, either. Emo was kind of getting popular around this time, so my mom/older sister just assumed I really liked the style (which, to be fair, I did).

As Fall came closer, I managed to get a really old PC we had laying around functional again, and booted up Runescape. At this point, I think I was 12 years old? It feels like a year is missing here, but maybe the story actually started when I was 11? Anyway, I hop on Runescape for old time’s sake, and lo and behold-Fawkes29 is online. I immediately message them, excited that I’ve gotten a chance to reunite with my friends.

Andy responds, and we talk for a little while, catching up on what all has happened. Danni is currently on vacation somewhere, but my memory is failing me on where it was. Andy tells me that he spent the summer at his mother’s home in Russia, and that he’s emo now. He tells me that he’s been depressed lately, and after a lot of prying, tells me that his mother molested him, and that he lives with his dad exclusively now. I am shocked to hear about the strange similarities between our recent experiences, and tell him about my own struggles, and the way I’ve been feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I remember that during this time, it felt like I had a weight on my chest all the time. It would literally ache because I just felt so…sad? I’m not sure how else to describe it. Looking back on it, that was fucking brutal to deal with as a preteen who had a mom and sisters that depended on him to be strong.

It’s a Sunday night when this conversation occurs, and as goofy as it might sound, Andy and I feel like we’re somehow connected in a supernatural/paranormal kind of way. This is the first ray of hope I’ve had in months, and it makes me feel special and unique. The sun starts to set, and he says he has to go. My mom then asks me to tag along with her while she goes and feeds the cat of one of our cousins, as she’s away from home visiting family elsewhere.

While my mom is feeding the cat, I wander out onto the porch and look into the sky. I see that there’s just a single star in the sky, and for whatever reason, remember being told once that you’re supposed to make a wish on the first star in the sky. I wish that I would be different - that my life will become exciting and full of hardships and trials that I can overcome. I want to be like my favorite character, Ichigo, from Bleach, at the time. I just want to be cool and confident and have an interesting and crazy life. Now, I wonder if that wish was a mistake. My mind constantly goes back to it, and it feels like perhaps if I didn’t wish for that, some of this stuff never would have happened.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Life continues to move forward. I start attending yet another new, south-east Missouri school full of people who hate the shit out of emos and constantly bully me for it - and being fat, of course. I grit my teeth and deal with it. At this time, I’m very much against hurting other people, and don’t want to fight back. I was a stupid kid. Andy and I continue talking basically every night for a couple weeks, Danni comes back, and we start hanging out like we did the first time around. Danni thinks these weird coincidences we had are pretty weird, and gets kind of quiet about it when it’s brought up. Dunno what that was about.

Eventually, Andy and I start noticing more similarities. We tend to have the same moods at the same times, more things in our life happen near-simultaneously. Shit’s just kind of weird, right? So we decide to start testing it out. This is the part where I realized with practical certainty that I wasn’t just being fucked with, and that maybe something actually was going on here. Andy would target a specific part of his body, not tell me anything, and cut it with a knife (emo as fuck, I know). I could feel a strange, sharp tingly feeling, and would tell him what body part it was. I was right every time, as far as he was telling me.

Then, I started doing the same. He got it right every single time. Keep in mind I was using a computer with a processor so old that it ran Runescape with lag, didn’t have the money for speakers, let alone a mic or headphones or a webcam, anything like that. To top it off, even if we did, my mom was always very nervous about me talking to people online, and refused to let me get a webcam or use things like MSN messenger or AIM (Not that that stopped me, I was reasonably tech savvy in comparison to her). 

So we’re probably states away, and there is no possible way for him to know if I’m stabbing my forearm, my ankle, my stomach, or if I’m even stabbing anything at all. Yet, whether I did something or claimed I did and actually did nothing, he was able to guess the right spot (or that there wasn’t a spot) literally 100% of the time. I want to say that I had a brain and that this freaked me the fuck out, but the reality was, I remembered the wish I made on that star, and I wanted so desperately to be different and live a unique life, that this just made me super excited. 

We then officially dubbed ourselves “Connection Brothers”. It’s not an original name, and it sounds pretty fucking stupid, actually. But we just knew that somehow, the two of us were connected in a way that nobody else we knew of was. We started testing the range of this strange ability we had. Trying to focus on a certain thought, or a certain feeling. Emotions seemed to work better than thinking of a word or an object, and we could only really get it some of the time (which, as of now, I would like to chalk up to coincidence or luck, despite some of the evidence suggesting otherwise). Over time, it felt like the connection got stronger the more we talked and spent time hanging out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, during the next few months, at random times, I start having strange dreams. I was at one point a pretty hardcore Christian kid - the type that would sing songs about God because it made me happy and feel like I was closer to him. After my parents divorced and depression hit, I guess I decided that God just didn’t exist anymore. 

The first dream I had, some Native American guy and I were standing out in a field that looked like it was nearby. He said something to me, but I didn’t understand it. Like, I couldn’t even hear his voice. Suddenly, his eyes started glowing blue-green, and I instantly recognized him as some kind of demon. We started fighting - I held up surprisingly well against him, I think. He was using some kind of tooth or something that was sharpened and fashioned into a knife. He started getting the upper hand, and right before he killed me, a massive, white wooden cross fell out of the sky, impaling into the ground. He looked at it, muttered in a SUPER deep voice something I couldn’t understand, and then fled the scene. The sun suddenly shined in the sky, and I woke up.

The next dream I had, I was trapped in my bedroom, but it was slightly altered. Like, the door was both there, and it wasn’t. I felt this strange burning sensation all around me, like something was rapidly coming for me and engulfing me in itself. It felt like I was being smothered, couldn’t breathe, my vision started going dark, save for the doorway that was there in one eye, and a solid wall in the other eye. In the doorway, a very blurred, morphed silhouette of a man was hovering. I swear it was facing me. Something suddenly wrapped its arms around me, and I felt such a pleasant sensation at the touch of its skin. I couldn’t see it - my vision actually got shielded completely - but if I were religious, I would have sworn it was an angel or something. Someone who meant to do nothing but protect me. I suddenly woke up feeling…weirdly good. Secure.

The third dream I had, and I know it was terrifying, but I have absolutely no memory of what happened. I remember the burning heat again, I remember thinking that I was going to be taken straight to Hell, I remember that whatever happened, it was absolutely fucking horrible. But there’s nothing else I can remember.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It’s at this point in my memory where things start to get really hazy for a while. I’m trying to remember what happened, but it’s actually kind of sketching me out how little I remember. I’ll try to summarize what I can here:

Basically, after a few months, sometime in February maybe, Danni tells Andy and I that she knows about this phenomenon, and that she has a connection with four of her friends. Yeah…Four. As in like, all five of them are connected. This part I believe was faked by Danni, and possibly Andy was forced to go along with it. I dunno. But then Danni goes on to form a club in their school with Andy, called the Connection Brothers. The goal was to find more people like us, people who might have connections with each other. 

I guess her idea was, the connection most likely brings people together sooner or later, because of the way the coincidences work and all that. People who are connected are probably drawn to each other in one way or another. The club actually ended up getting like 60-80 members, if I remember correctly. They went to a pretty huge public school. Shortly after this, Danni and Andy suddenly break up. This blindsided the hell out of me, and ultimately, I come to understand that Andy broke up with Danni. He then seems to go kind of off the deep end, gets a boyfriend, comes out as bisexual, and starts cutting himself a lot. I guess the trauma from his mom molesting him (which I then find out she did with the aid of a man she was seeing at the time) got to him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, in the real world, I’m going to bed one night in my tiny little bedroom. My emotions are still all over the place, and I’m still often feeling soul-crushingly sad and I don’t understand why. I sit down on my tiny single-wide mattress on the floor, and just kind of stare at the floor for a minute. Out of nowhere, a sudden heat hits my face. It was like it was just a cloud of heat, I honestly don’t know how else to describe it. It was cold as fuck because we couldn’t afford the heat, so when this hit, I had no explanation for it. In that moment, I remember feeling extremely unsafe and probably the most dread-filled I had ever felt in my life. I grabbed my blanket, left my bedroom in a hurry, and laid on the floor in the living room.

My older sister at this point was sleeping on the pull-out bed in the couch in the living room. She asks me what’s wrong, but I can’t bring myself to answer or really even say shit. She goes and gets my mom, probably sketched out at how I’m acting, and as soon as my mom touches me, I just absolutely break down. I spent the next three days missing school and crying my eyes out almost constantly. I told my sisters and mom about it, and my sisters think it was some kind of demon, and my mom thinks that maybe the effects of the divorce and the fact that I’ve tried to be someone they could lean on for so long finally got to be too much for me to shoulder without help.

I say and choose not to believe in ghosts or demon in the present day - but my honest opinion? I’m pretty sure it was both. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I’m probably 13 years old. My older sister has an emo friend named Brett that she brings over one day, and I’m pretty excited because this guy is fun, actually pretty cool, and treats me like a human being. Even says some inspiring shit about how I should dress how I want to and be whoever I want to be. Brett comes over semi-frequently, but this day was different. We’re hanging out in the bedroom, me, Brett, My sister, and her boyfriend, Dustin, all cramped up on the tiny mattress. Brett is looking through a random old yearbook my sister found stashed away in the house when we first moved into it. Shit’s old, dusty, and black and white. All kinda joking around, having a decent time, and I ask Brett a question. Silence. I look over, and he’s now just staring blankly at the wall. I say his name several times, my sister says his name a couple times, and shakes him. He doesn’t respond. Dustin is pretty sketched out, but he’s kind of the quiet type.

Brett then stands up, eyes still glazed over in a blank stare, and starts walking out of the bedroom. I squeeze in between him, and start walking backwards, trying to get his attention as he walks down the hall. He’s still not responding to any attempts to get his attention. Guy goes all the way outside, and walks right up to the well we have in our yard. Fucking dunks his head in it. My sister grabs his shoulders and pulls him out, and he starts shaking like a motherfucker and looks scared as shit. We take him inside, my mom is now here, gets him a towel, and we try to ask him what’s up. He says he doesn’t know, that it felt like something was just controlling him, and then the glaze suddenly returns.

And then shit hits the fucking fan. It’s dark out at this point, and Brett starts screaming shit in Latin (I wish I was joking) in like a straight up screamo voice, flailing his arms all over the place and throwing shit. For whatever reason, I kick into gear like I’ve been doing this my whole life, and tell my sister and Dustin to hold him down. My sister isn’t strong, and neither is her boyfriend, but she is a PRETTY BIG BITCH if you catch my drift. Probably pushing 300\~ pounds. She sits on him to keep him still, but he’s still screaming shit and randomly adding in nasty death threats in English. My mom is properly wtfed out, and I tell her to go grab the Bible out of her bedroom. I have lost my faith in God at this point, and still don’t believe in any of that shit, but at the moment, this is just what my brain was telling me to do.

My mom brings the bible in here, and I tell her to start reading the Lord’s Prayer, bc I don’t know my way around a fucking bible. Brett then starts going even more ballistic, literally lifts my sister up (this guy is like 115 lbs soaking wet, 5’8”). Dustin jumps on top of the both of them, sending Brett back down to the couch. I also join in, struggling to keep him down while he starts lifting the fucking lot of us. My mom starts shouting the prayer at the top of her lungs, he’s screaming like a motherfucker, and then I notice he’s suddenly whimpering and panicking. I get everyone off of him, he’s once again shaking, crying, and absolutely terrified. We call his parents, talk to them a bit, Dustin has gotten into his car and fucked off (can’t blame him, he was shaken up as fuck, and said he was really sensitive to supernatural shit and this just felt *wrong* to him). 

Later found out that Brett’s parents took him in for multiple psychological evaluations, and they all basically told his parents that he wasn’t crazy and didn’t have anything wrong with him. Still not sure what happened that day. Older sister swears up and down he was possessed by a demon, and my mom refuses to talk about it. I just like to pretend it didn’t happen, for the most part. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Back to Danni and Andy, they stop playing Runescape, and they both get me to start messaging them on their YouTube channel (Also with the name Fawkes29 - Last I checked, and it still exists-Fuck, I just checked again and it doesn’t anymore). This was back before Google owned Youtube, and you could have your own Youtube page with a lot of customization, and you could send people messages and had an inbox and shit. So for whatever reason, Andy continues to use Danni’s YouTube as a way to speak to me. I think she actually did this because he refused to talk to her, and she still wanted to keep an eye on him, as well as to spy on our conversations. 

Danni at this point is probably the most invested in my friendship with her that she’s ever been. She clearly still cares about Andy, and she serves as my only real positive support system at this point. Most of my conversations with Andy begin to turn into arguments, and…Idk. I don’t remember a lot of it anymore, but it felt like he hated me. I still loved him as a brother, but I often got upset with him. He treated me pretty badly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My mom sent me to a therapist who actually turned out to be a shitty old man who, I think in an attempt to try to get me to relate to him, would often talk about South Park. I got prescribed anti-depressants, but I ended up making my mom take them instead, as I felt she needed them more than I did. I guess she agreed, because she did actually start taking them. She probably figured if I was going to refuse anyway, she might as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually Andy tells me Gabriel isn’t his real name, starts going by Michael for a while, and then finally tells me his name is Andy. Danni tells me that he’d recently started a band called Black Veil Brides. Yes. I wish I was joking, but this is what they were actually telling me. Do I believe it?

That one I’m not really sure on. One day, I tried to get Andy to prove he was who he was by tweeting something. Sure enough, a few moments later, he tweets about something random. I’m choosing to chalk that up to coincidence, because I refuse to believe that I was at one point connected to the lead singer of Black Veil Brides. Not that I hate their music or anything, but it just sounds pretty retarded and far-fetched to me. I dunno.

More time passes, I continue trying to keep contact with Danni and Andy, but they’re both around less and less. Then, I come to the realization that my mom can’t support my siblings and I all at once anymore. She’s working a shitty job on her own, and just can’t do it. I make the decision to move in with my father - Something I told her was because I wanted to do. I could see the way she was constantly stressed out, and how difficult and tight money was. 

Honestly, though, I’m not sure I would have made such a responsible decision today knowing what I do now. I thought my depression was bad when I lived with my mom, but with my dad, the same guy that molested me in the one place I felt safe…Man. With Danni and Andy essentially no longer speaking to me, no support systems, no friends, nothing, I went to live with my father. He and his girlfriend, and her spoiled, shitty brat of a son. The good news was I had my own room. The bad news was, I got emotionally abused a lot during this time, and my dad liked to do things like wait until I had fallen asleep, then run in and jump on my chest or slap the hell out of me all over my body. Things he said he was “just joking” with. I also ended up losing about ¾ of my right eardrum because I had a bad infection that he refused to take me to the doctor for.

Long story short, living with my dad was a new kind of hell. I attempted suicide twice during my stay with him, neither of which anybody ever found out about. Once, I slit my wrists and hoped I would bleed out - woke up and was totally fine. Other time, downed a bunch of painkillers, but I guess I didn’t take enough, idk.

I was an emotional, attention-hungry dumbass.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the summer after I turned 14, I’m suddenly contacted by Andy again. He’s doing a bit better, and strangely enough, we get on Runescape to hang out again. He has a new boyfriend, and has made some friends. Life seems to be going okay for him, and we aren’t arguing. He introduces me to two people - Alec, and Brandon. Alec is around Andy’s age (17ish?) at this point, and Brandon is my age. 

As soon as Alec and I start talking, everybody knew. I don’t know how to explain it. It wasn’t a connection brother kind of thing - it was like, love at first sight? I know that sounds retarded. I think it sounds retarded, too. But I got this weird, special kind of tingly feeling in my chest the second he sent “hello” on fucking Runescape. I don’t know that you could make this shit up. Alec and I instantly hit it off, and before I know it, I’ve come to the realization that I’m probably bisexual, like Andy. Funnily enough, it’s at the same age he realized. Alec and I start an online relationship, and things go well for a little while. Brandon and I become good friends, and the CB (Connection Brothers) group Danni created is actually still going strong. They have a meetup in Georgia (Which I was unable to attend in person-so I attended via Andy’s laptop), and for whatever reason, people start speculating that Brandon and I are also connection brothers.

Brandon and I were fairly similar - but I don’t know that I ever really felt that we were connected in that way. At least, not like it was with Andy or with Alec. There is also talk of several of them developing special abilities. Danni supposedly could “know” the outcome of certain future events. It wasn’t like seeing the future, so much as having an understanding of it, was the best way she could describe it. I honestly don’t know, and I never developed anything similar, unless I’ve just never recognized it as something special, somehow. Andy claimed he was part angel, as well. Things started sounding way too crazy for my liking, but…

This time in my life, I leaned into these people really hard. They were the only light I had in a Hell full of darkness. I went along with some of the weird shit they said, because it meant that I still had friends I cared about. So it was pretty devastating when Alec said he was also going to join a band one day, and then never came back to talk to me again. Additionally, Andy and I begin arguing constantly again, and we also stop talking.

My memory is still pretty hazy here, but probably a few years go by, I’m now 16/17 years old, and I try to move back in with my mom. She has a boyfriend now, is doing much better financially and emotionally, and I can finally escape the hell that is my father’s home. My dad’s response to this?

He takes my cell phone, cuts off all communication I have with my mom, and keeps me like this for several months. My stepmom is pregnant at this point in time. 

One day, I come home from school, and nobody is there. ??? My phone is on the counter. I spend an entire weekend alone, with nobody contacting me, no idea where everyone is, nothing. Finally, after a week, my grandma of all people calls me, and tells me that my stepmom abruptly went into labour, my baby brother was born two months premature, and that they would probably be up at the hospital in St. Louis, MO for a month or two. Then, just like that, hangs up. I continue going to school, get really into One Piece, start slowly climbing out of the crippling depression I’m dealing with, and life living on my own is honestly amazing.

Occasionally, groceries would be left on the doorstep when I would get home from school. Don’t know who was buying them, nobody ever told me and I don’t want to talk to my dad to ask about it, so shrug. I actually managed to pull myself out of the rut I was in and started feeling happy for the first time in like 6 years. I was going on jogs in the park at midnight, still getting plenty of sleep via naps, going to class and getting great grades, it was the best place I had ever been in. Then, out of nowhere one day, my dad and stepmom return with the baby, and my step brother. Like two weeks of pure hell goes by where my dad controls everything about my life, and then he suddenly tells me he’s sending me back to live with my mom again, because he’s not going to pay for me to eat anymore.

Cool beans. I’ll fucking take it, boys. I move back in with my mom, I’m happy again, she missed the fuck out of me and I get real close with her, my sisters start looking up to me as a responsible and smart older brother, things go back to the way they were before, only I’m happy now. I do good in school (although end up hanging out with a girl who was my best friend for a while who was emotionally manipulative as shit), and things go pretty well. My thoughts of Andy, Alec, Danni, the CB bullshit, all of that are long behind me. I meet a fantastic human being, and we start dating. Everything in my life is going great, man.

At some point, I end up getting a message from Danni’s account on Runescape while randomly hopping on one day. The person messaging me claims that his name is Vaclav. Vaclav tells me he’s Andy’s cousin, and that Andy wanted him to keep an eye on me. Vaclav is also a dick to me, and tells me he doesn’t give a shit about me. Being a desperate teenager, I deal with his bullshit, and eventually he gets me to get on a game that he played regularly, OurWorld. Some of you might be familiar with it, but I doubt it. It was a pretty shit game. It still exists, weirdly enough.

I guess he would only randomly check Runescape on Danni’s account to see if I happened to be active. Apparently Danni changed her youtube password at some point and locked Andy out of the account. I really wish I could still access all of those messages back and forth we had. Anyway.

Vaclav had his own account on OurWorld, so I kept in contact with him for a long time. Eventually he got bored of the game and I added him on Facebook, but ultimately, that too, resulted in him deleting his account and never contacting me again. There’s a part of me that suspects that Vaclav was actually in charge of everything this whole time, and that everyone else was fake - but one event proved that at least one person DID exist.

One day out of nowhere I get an email from Danni. I don’t know how she got my email. She wants to talk on the phone?? I give her my number, go out into the woods to be away from my family, and talk with Danni for about an hour. I realize that she’s black (which was just kind of weird because I always had a different mental image of her idk?), and she tells me she just spent four months in a coma, and only recently woke up. The coma was apparently stress-induced, as she was in college and working a lot and everything just got to be too much for her. We talk briefly about Vaclav, and she asks me if I’ve heard his accent yet. I was never able to get him to call me, but apparently he still has a pretty strong British accent.

She tells me that she stopped talking to me because she got angry with me, and had never planned on speaking to me again, but that she was glad she reached out. She also told me she loved me…In a romantic way. That she had felt that way for a while. At this point, I am a year deep into a relationship with someone that I am extremely invested in - my fiance to this day (It will be 8 years strong in May 2022). I don’t really know how to respond, but I tell Danni that I love her as a friend, and I’m really glad she reached out. She then says she has to go, and once again - doesn’t reply to me any further. To this day, I still haven’t heard a word from her. I’m tired of all the whiplash from these fuckers, honestly.

As I think about this stuff more and more, more memories are coming to surface. Back when I was living in the home in Patterson, I had a series of dreams about this demon girl that called herself Abigail. It was never really clear to me if she was the one that caused the issue with Brett, but she actually showed up to me in several dreams all the way up until I was 16. The last dream I had about her, I was in some underground room in a big city, and she was chained up to the wall. She had several IV drips going into her, and her veins were glowing neon green. She acted like she was pretty fond of me, but I’m pretty sure my intentions in the dream were pretty nasty for her. I actually feel pretty fond of her, and wish she would show herself to me again, but honestly it’s probably just a series of autistic dreams I had while wishing I had a girlfriend, so who knows. I’m good at brushing this shit off by now.

Anyways, that's the gist of it. Had some strange connection-like coincidences with some weird people, and there's also this guy Robert I forgot to talk about, but if anyone wants to know about him and his side of things, I'd be happy to elaborate further.

Sorry if this was all a big letdown. It's pretty hazy in my head anymore. It was just...a weird life, growing up. Sometimes I get this bad feeling that I'm missing very important memories. It makes me feel sad in the way I used to, but I tend to shake it off quickly. I try not to dwell on it if I can help it.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,935080,public,new,nsfw,My Teenaged Years,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/ri983o/my_teenaged_years/,promo_adult_nsfw,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

first we went outside and I walked no more than 2 feet away from the door and felt something wet under my foot. i checked my shoes and there was a slug (it didn’t look like a normal slug but idk what else to call it) just in the middle of my shoe. i have no clue how it got there because i know it wasn’t there when I put them on. as i’m trying to figure out what the hell is in my shoes my dog starts freaking out and growling at the house across the street. she doesn’t this somewhat commonly because they have dogs that attacked her once, so I do didn’t think much of it and went inside to get another pair of shoes. 

i walked back outside and was immediately struck with the feeling that something was wrong. this first time I was out I heard weird quiet music but just thought the neighbors were playing something. this time the music was gone but there was this incessant high pitched shriek periodically. me and my dog literally stopped. just stopped and stood for like a minute listening. there was this periodic shriek and then this other sound, like a high pitched bark (definitely not a fox, i know that sound and none of the dogs in the area bark like that) every now and again. the worst part is that everything was SILENT. 

if you live in the country you know it’s never silent, not even in the winter. i took a recording on my phone of the noises but they weren’t super loud so it didn’t pick them up very well. so i’m feeling a little weird but i get scared easy so I try to brush it off and let my dog go to the bathroom. as soon as I stop the recording my dog starts flipping out, hackles raised, growling, barking, and jumping at something behind us in the yard. she didn’t have to tell me twice so we ran to the door and inside the house. I shut the door behind us and immediately felt relief. i felt like I was being chased trying to get to the door. my dog ran around the house and did a check out of the windows to make sure everything was clear I guess and went to bed.

My bf and I go to bed at a certain time everynight.

So basically nothing changes so I'm 100% sure there was no cat in the room at the time.

Well, everyone was in their spots. I get into bed, put the blanket over myself, and maybe 10 mins pass by. When it feels like a cat jumped onto the bed and is by my feet. So I sigh and start running through the names so they can come towards me. But, the feeling disappears and my bf asks me what I was talking about. I'm like there's a cat in here I swear I just felt it. I sit up, turn the lights on, and look in any spot that I know can have a cat in it and nothing. Let's just say freaked me out enough to go pass our bedtime and watch TV. 

The dog that sleeps on the bed was by my stomach when this happened and the other dog was in his kennel with the door closed. My bf didn't feel anything even though it felt like it jumped up from his side of the bed. And in the morning there was no cat to let out of the room if there was one stuck in here.

Outside Ödeshög there is a forest that stretches quite far. If you go in a bit, maybe 15 minutes, you will come to the ""Child Murderer Cross"". The story goes like this:

""The locals tell us that at the end of the 19th century there was a house in this place. Anna Stina Samuelsdotter lived here. It is said that she was a prostitute. In the 19th century, prostitution was even considered a medical need. Healthy men were judged to need to visit prostitutes to maintain their health. But Anna became pregnant and the children she gave birth to were killed and hung up in the tree. This is said to have caused all the branches of the tree to grow in the same direction.  Those who have visited the Child Murderer's Cross say that they have heard baby crying and seen lightbults coming up one road and then disappearing into the forest. Whatever the case of the stories, the secluded location, the overgrown foundation of the house and the strange tree the Child Murderer's Cross make it a rather spooky and haunted place. There is a well-known story about a young couple who must have pitched their tent at the Child Murderer's Cross to spend the night. They suddenly woke up to a deafening baby cry. Panicked, the couple fled the scene and left both tents and belongings behind. They never returned to pick them up. "" 

I'm very interested in the paranormal, as is my friend. So we thought it sounded like a great idea to go there. After all, I had an EMF meter, which senses the surroundings. We went there during the day, we're not stupid that way.

When we got there, we saw that the tree had become so vandalized that only the stump was left. But people have painted upside down crosses on other trees. The tree has always been seen as the evil that exists on the site and therefore people have probably destroyed it. But when we were there, my friend was a little nauseous. She's a little sensitive to paranormal stuff. We walked around and looked a bit for the foundation of the house. We found it a little further from the road. I got some reaction to EMF but not much. My friend and I looked at each other and decided to walk around the open plan next to the foundation. Just as we stood there asking questions, it was like, well, it got quiet. We might have heard some bird before but now it was so deafeningly quiet. I looked in among the trees and got a very familiar feeling in me. That someone was watching us from the trees. You know that feeling when you know that someone (maybe a friend) who is hiding to jump out and scare you, you say ""ha I knew you were there"". That was the feeling. So if I had approached one of the trees and looked behind it, I would surely have found something. That feeling. But the security of the light from the day kept us calmer. Had it been night, we would have easily died of fear. Then it would be harder to see something. I looked at my friend and asked if we should go when we both started to feel anxious. My friend had crouched down a bit and held her stomach and said that she was feeling unwell and how it was burning in her neck. I looked but could not see anything. She told me it was like a burning sensation. And I said, ""Yes, now we go.""

When we got to my car and when I was about to pick up the key, we heard a big ""BANG"" from my car. Like someone stomped hard on the car floor. It has not sounded like that before. We looked at each other.

Me: ""Not my car!""

Friend: ""Did you hear that? Just when we're leaving too! It sounded like it came from the trunk!""

Me: ""No, do not say she's hiding in the luggage.""

I opened the luggage but nothing was there. We looked everywhere but nothing was there. We jumped in. I looked at my friend and said, ""Look now when it's not starting."" I pulled the key, it was a bit sluggish but went and started. When we drove along the forest, the feeling was not over.

We spent about 3 years looking to buy a small house for just us and our cat (who was about 11).  We made offer after offer only to get outbid every time.  Getting discouraged, we decided to try again. We found a cute little house close to the city for a very low price.  When we googled the address, we found it was owned by a clown!  I told my husband, ""You watch, THIS will be the one who accepts our offer"".  I was RIGHT. We got it for less than what the seller was asking. Unheard of in this market today. Well, sadly, it was a DECEASED clown.  Which is why we got it for less, because when someone dies in a house, it gets a rep as a ''stigma house"", and people generally dont like to buy homes like that. Her brother was selling the house.  She was a lady clown, tutu wearing, rainbow eyelashes and all, loved by all in the neighborhood.  A good soul who went to childrens hospitals to do her clown gig for the kids. Sadly, she died in the bathtub. She lived alone. No husband or children, so it was her brother who found her, and who was selling the house.  After we moved in and started renovating. I found some of her business cards with her picture on it all in her clown get up.  I gave it an honored place on the refrigerator.  Ok, here is where it gets strange.....  My husbands sister and brother in law came to visit us and see the new house.  I bought a key lime pie to offer them with coffee for their visit.  The PIE FLIPPED ITSELF ONTO THE FLOOR!

So we tried to make him as comfortable as possible.   The strange thing was, HE KEPT TRYING TO GET IN THE BATHTUB! This cat normally wouldn't go near a tub.  Since our former owner died in the tub, we wondered if she was beckoning him to come with her. Less than a week after our cat passed,  we found a key...in the bathtub!

That’s not for me to say. 

But, I can tell you, as a person who does have an entity attachment and has had one for about a decade, your own mind is your greatest weapon against spiritual invaders. I won’t go into detail, but I will say when you think about it, it give the entity energy. It’s an exercise in controlling your mind. If you see or hear or feel something, simply say go away and think about something else. 

I learned this when I first discovered my attachment. It got scary, so I went to see a healer for her and she told me “stop thinking about it” and it was hard. It took me years to get where I am now, where I could just say stop and it stops, as well as hardly ever bothers me these days. 

Some entity attachments can be stopped and their chosen person can get freed, some refuse to go. Some respond to sage, crystals, whatever.. some don’t. 

But if you have something troubling you or attacking you in your sleep, or following you, or whatever.. the best advice I can give, with my own lived experience, is overcome your fear and control your mind.

I've been having some weird experiences in my house ever since I moved in six years ago. For context, the house was built within the last 15 years and it has only been home to two or three families. However, the house has been witness to a lot of negativity including divorce, tears, and suspected domestic violence from a previous family. 

I apologize for the long post, I just want to include as much information as I can. Something is definitely in the house and I think I may need help.

One of the first things I've noticed is the thing's ability to mimic voices and other sounds. The best example that comes to mind is an incident that took place once when I was home alone. I went to my office to get some paper when I started hearing footsteps and banging cabinets in the kitchen, down the hall. It was so distinct and loud that I actually thought someone broke in and I grabbed a letter opener to defend myself. When I investigated, no one was in the kitchen; however, I thought I saw a black figure standing on my stair landing as I walked by, peering around the banister at me.

A similar incident took place a few months ago. I was trying to go to sleep in my bedroom downstairs when I suddenly heard the doors upstairs slamming open and shut. My room seems to be especially active. The TV in the room often turns on and off on its own and the picture frames I have hanging on the wall occasionally rock back and forth in the night.

The thing often mimics my daughters' voices. As I was getting ready one morning, I heard a voice that sounded like my eldest coming from my closet, saying ""Hey Mom."" This is just one of several incidents. I also tend to hear scratching and breathing noises coming from the closet at night.

The thing in the house also moves things around when I'm not looking. I heard a crash coming from my office one night, and when my daughter and I walked in to investigate, we saw that a few books had been tossed off my shelf, landing farther away than they would have if they'd simply fallen. I also had my metronome moved quietly off of my piano and onto the floor several feet away.

Finally, there was one especially jarring incident where I thought I saw the thing in the house. I was outside grilling dinner in the yard and I decided to turn around and glance through my downstairs window. Something in me just told me to look. I swear that in the window, I saw this emaciated, skeletal-looking entity. It couldn't have been more than five feet tall, but it was looking out the window, right back at me.

Honestly, I'm at a loss. I have no idea what the thing in my house is. I know some of the information must sound contrived and ridiculous, but I swear it's all true. My two young adult daughters, who are both skeptics, also believe something is in the house. The both have told me that they hear the mimicked voices and crashing sounds too. 

Does anyone have any advice or any idea what this thing may be?

In every stage of life and every home I’ve lived in. 

When I was a baby, my mum was taking a nap whilst I slept in my cot. She was half asleep when she saw a man walk into the room, take his cap off and place it on the nightstand. Thinking it was my dad, she asked “you’re home from work early?” He never replied. When she opened her eyes, no one was there and no cap was sat on the night stand. 

When I was around 5/6 years old, I walked downstairs early in the morning before any one was awake to get myself something to drink. Our old kitchen was a horrible orange colour with these horrible sheer orange curtains that you could see through. When I walked into the kitchen, I saw a man/boy sat on the window sill, knees up to his chest. I could see him through the curtains, but not clear enough to see much detail. I remember running back up the stairs as fast as I could, jumping on top of my sleeping sister. My mum and sister always remind me of that story and are shocked when I tell them I remember it vividly. 

My sister reported that she used to hear one of the dining room table chairs scraping along the floor most nights when we were all upstairs in bed. 

When I was around 8, we moved to a new house. Few things happened to me there: the bathroom tap was one of those old generic taps that you have to twist to turn on. One day I remember suddenly realising that I could hear gushing water coming from the bathroom (next to my bedroom). When I investigated I found the bathroom tap twisted all the way on, to the point where it took me a good 20 seconds to turn it off completely. I didn’t see anyone go into that bathroom. 

I also had a reoccurring nightmare when I lived in that house, which I would dream about once every month or so. 
I only found this out recently, but my mother and sister both reported seeing a dark shadow moving across the wall on the upstairs hallway towards my bedroom, and disappearing once it reached my open doorway. They reported seeing this separately on multiple occasions. 

One night in that house, when I was around 10 years old, I had coke back from a bike ride with my father around autumn time. A car had drove through a puddle and absolutely soaked the both of us. My dad went into the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee whilst I sat on the sofa to watch tv. I suddenly felt a chunk of my wet hair drop onto my shoulder as if it had been picked up in the air. When I looked at it, I saw the chunk was slowly unraveling, as if it had been picked up and twisted around someone’s finger. 

Months later, I told my mum the story, to which she freaked out and Told me how her father (who had died of cancer around a month before the incident) used to sneak up behind her and twist her hair as a child to make her jump. 

We moved to my current home when I was around 12. A lot of stuff went on in that house and I always felt a heavy presence. 

We had laminated flooring in our living room, and one night whilst my parents were out shopping, I heard something being dragged slowly across the floor. I figured it must have been my cat pawing at a plug that was lying on the floor (we had a floor lamp which was almost always unplugged). I thought this up until my parents came home. When my mother opened the door I heard her say “come on then - in you come”. She was speaking to my cat who had been outside the entire time they were out. 

I have had my feet scratched whist I have been trying to sleep. I have heard loud, heavy footsteps walk through the kitchen in the middle of the day, thinking my dad had come home from work early. I have heard my mother call my name / cough / sigh when she has not been home. I’ve seen black shapes moving towards me from the corner of my eye. 

I’m not sure if these incidents are unrelated, or if I’m being followed my something specific. My mum is a believer in the practice of wicca and paganism, and she decided to practice smudging and saging (the burning of a stick of sage to cleanse negative energy and invite positive energy). 

I wouldn’t class myself as a hardcore Wiccan/pagan, but I defiantly believe the practices to an extent. Ever since my mother saged the house, the experiences have stopped and I no longer feel a dark presence. 

I still have the odd experience every now and again, but I no longer feel haunted.

We’re walking down the street and look towards my right at one of the old houses and there’s some naked thing standing in the door way.

So I continue walking without saying anything to my friend. We keep going not saying a word to each other. We’re down the street from the house and I finally turn to my friend and ask if he saw that thing. He said yeah man I thought I was just tripping out. 😂

Growing up our house felt dark. Because of the placements of the windows not much sun would shine in. Other than that it was a normal home, there were little things here and there that were odd though. There was a room at the end of the hall that my best friend and I would have our sleep overs in, like a second family room, that was connected to the kitchen. We would be up giggling late at night and we would hear what sounded like the cupboard shutting. Since that family room didnt have a door and it was closer to the kitchen I always made her sleep closest to it, terrible, I know lol. 

Also, in the middle of the nights I would hear what sounded like someone running along side the length of our roof. My mother has also heard this. I always told myself that someone was doing parkour in our neighborhood and that would put me at ease enough to forget about the noise and fall asleep.

Once my younger sister said she woke up one night and there was a little girl with a scary face in her doorway. We didnt believe her much. 

When I was 19 I moved into that room at the end of the kitchen. More independence as it was far away from the other side of the house with all the bedrooms. Sleeping in that room I would feel like something was in the corner sometimes. In the shadows. Watching me. 

Since it didnt have a door I used those wooden room spliters that people change behind. One night I'm on my phone under the covers in the dark and I hear what sounds like someone THROW themselves on the floor. I sat straight up in the dark and called out to my sister assuming it might have been her. We had no dogs or pets and even though it was out of character for my sister to do something like that, that was my first and only assumption as to what had made that noise. As I sat in bed, my eyes adjusting to the dark I hear that thing start crawling on the carpet and go under my bed. Hitting my shoe boxes underneath. When I tell you I LEAPED out of bed and ran to go get my dad. He came to my room all half asleep, laid on my bed, told me there was nothing there and went back to his room. I sat on my desk across the room from my bed, staring at the space underneath my bed. Even at 19 there was no way I was looking under there, and what - be confronted with a monster so hideous and so traumatizing? Growing up on paranormal and horror films my imagination really was my own enemy at one point. After what felt like hours, I told myself I had imagined the whole thing and knowing I had to get up for school in 2 hours I laid back down in bed. As I got comfortable on my back, my bed began to...breathe? The mattress beneath me rose a bit and sank a bit. Rose and sank. I just stared at the ceiling in the dark trying to calm my breathing and keep my heart from exploding out my ears. 

I dont remember falling asleep but I woke up the next morning feeling fine. I never felt that watchful feeling again. It's as if that thing crawled back home from a portal underneath my bed. 

After a couple of days I finally lifted my bed up to check underneath and all my shoe boxes were perfectly aligned how I left them.

I love reading all your stories. I’ve commented some but I’ve never read a story like the one I’m going to tell you. I had hope that I would so I wouldn’t be the only one and could get some perspective/insights on what y’all think.

When I was growing up, my family lived in this huge, beautiful southern style home. I loved it. I have very good memories there. However, it was the most “active” home of all that I’ve lived in since. Very active. But only to my mother and I. My 2 brothers and my dad never had any experiences. My mother had a couple. I was the only girl and about 3 when we moved in and I had ALOT. 

At first, being so young, I didn’t think anything of the experiences. I didn’t know any better. Later, I’d find out they were not what other people see or interact with normally. I will just tell you all the one that most stands out.

One night, I woke up and rolled over. I was barely awake and it was dark in the room (I didn’t have a nightlight).
There was some black thing lingering at the foot of my bed. I couldn’t make it out right then. I sat upright in my bed and tried to make it out. I still couldn’t really. So I got on my knees and leaned toward it. Now, remember, the whole room is dark but I can clearly see it’s something there. It’s not a figure. It’s just suspended in darkness. As I leaned towards it, within 2ft, it looks like a hand but not a hand because it only has three fingers, bent slightly as if they were just hanging there. It had no fingernails but pointy tips. It wasn’t connected to any body either. I just leaned back against my head frame and watched it until I fell back asleep. It never moved. 

This happened a couple more times but it seemed to be closer to me each time. Then one night my cousin stayed over and she slept with me. I woke up and rolled over to face her and it was right there, in my face, hanging directly over her as she slept. It had never been that close before. I was scared but I could actually reach out and touch it and I wanted to. I reached my arm out and then pulled it back. I never did touch it. I just watched it until I went to sleep again. 
That was the last time I saw it.

Fast forward, 10yrs. I was helping my mom in the kitchen with supper. As we were talking that old house came up. I finally told her what I saw and she immediately stopped what she was doing. She asked me more. Then she took two pieces of paper out and asked me to draw it. While I was she was doing something on the other piece of paper. When I finished and she finished, she asked that we swap papers and we did. She had drawn the same thing. We both just looked at each other in amazement. 

She told me when she was little she had went to a slumber party. All the girls slept on the living room floor in sleeping bags. She said she woke up in the middle of the night and saw this claw thing hanging over the girl next to her. She reached out to touch it and before she did, the girl screamed loudly. Everyone woke up and the girl was crying and saying someone had pinched her. My mom was accused of doing this. She swore she never would have done such a thing.

Well these apartments were kinda ghetto, gangs, drugs, overdoses, a landlord that didn’t remember anything due to her always being on drugs. We didn’t know that until we moved in. My sister and I got the bigger room since we were sharing and my mom got the smaller room with a small walk in closet, this place always had a weird vibe to it but this was our home now. We had our black cat with us.
One day I went into my mom room and I was just chilling and talking with her on her bed, we started hearing a soft scratching sound like our cat was trying to get out of the closet, as I was getting up our cat came into the bedroom from the hallway. I freaked out, what the hell is that noise in the closet then? A rat? A bug? Something rubbing on the closet like a hanger or something? I grabbed something next to me so I would be able to hit it if it was a big or something. I opened the door and NOTHING was there we looked at everything that could’ve made a noise. Nothing. Well chargers and lamps started being unplugged and put in the middle of the room when no one was home, weird but didn’t really freak out over it. One day my mom was taking a nap and my sister and I were talking in the living room. All of a sudden we hear something say my name like they were running towards my moms bedroom. I froze in place and my sister did as well, “dude did you just freaking hear that?” “I did!” We slowly walked to my moms room to see if she was awake and just called me but she was dead asleep.

We decided to go outside and chill out there for a bit, one of our Neighbors came outside to smoke so my sister started a conversation and explained all the weird stuff happing to us, low and behold he tells us a little boy died in the closet, we asked which bedroom? And he said the smaller bedroom.

I'm typing on my phone on a train so apologies in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

My very elderly grandparents live in a farmhouse in the Scottish countryside. Over the years there have been numerous unexplained activities in the house but it's stepped up a gear the last few months.

Yesterday, my grandmother had a fresh bouquet of flowers in a vase on the kitchen table. They were one day old chrysanthemums. She made a cup of tea, watched the news for a couple of hours and when she went back to the kitchen the flowers were completely dead and bare. All the petals and blossom had disappeared completely. See the attached pic. They went from beautiful blooming flowers to this in the space of around 2-3 hours. Nobody else in the house. Can anyone explain this?

Back in August time, an old silver cigarette case appeared in the laundry room from nowhere. On closer inspection, my gran realised it had belonged to her dad and she had not seen it for decades. She thought it had been lost in the move nearly 30 years ago. It was just lying there on the counter out of nowhere. My grandad had never seen it and didn't know anything about it. I wondered quietly if he maybe had found it and forgotten but we put it away in an old chest that also belonged to my grandmothers dad. A few weeks ago, the cigarette case turned up in the laundry room again, where it was first found and nobody had moved it or been into the chest to bring it out. We decided to leave it in the laundry room and it stayed there until last week when it appeared in the living room on the mantlepiece. I was there that day cleaning, there was nothing on any of the living room features but when we came back downstairs the cigarette case was on top of the mantlepiece clear as day with light condensation.

Items go missing all the time, i have always put it down to my grandparents being older and maybe forgetting what they done but it's not the case, it's happened with me when I've been there. My keys have moved, phone won't work, there's a strange feeling in the air.

The strangest one we have had was a few years ago. My. Grandmother had taken her rings off as usual when she went to bed and put them on the shelf next to the bed with her watch. In the morning, one of the rings was missing, her mother's engagement ring which was very sentimentsl so she looked for it straight away. My grandad helped, eventually my mum went to help them look because of how upset my gran was. I'd never seen her like that before, she was devastated. We moved the bed, lifted the carpet, opened every drawer and cupboard in the bedroom and bathroom. My grandad checked the sink and pipes incase it had fallen off when she was washing her hands and hadn't noticed. After three days she realised it had gone. A couple of weeks later, she woke up in the morning and there was the ring, just where she had left it those weeks before. We have never been able to explain that.

Has anybody got any advice? I'd like to find out what's happening and if I can do anything to help whoever it is because I feel these are messages.

So…I guess it started to begin sometime back in June right before graduation. As most people are, I was happily awaiting the day I’d finally be outta school, I was eager and excited. But I guess something sensed that and latched on to me. It was the week before graduation when I started to feel an extremely negative energy coming directly from a specific corner of my closet. My closet is one of the types where it’s two white folding doors that you slide open. I was just up watching YouTube that night…when it just felt like…kinda like I was being watched. It didn’t take long for me to realize where this feeling was coming from…the corner of my closet with a vent.

Now…I’m no idiot, I know we sometimes feel like we’re being watched even though nothing’s there…but this felt absolutely different. You know the scenes in that film Insidious where Dalton falls off the ladder in the dark attic and stares at the furnace? Or the scene where Elise is staring at the corner of the ceiling at the demon and no one else can see it? That’s what it felt like. It wasn’t just that occasional feeling of I’m being watched, it was the feeling of “if I look away, something’s gonna pounce from that corner and eat me alive”. The presence felt…threatening.

So I took some sage and smudged my room, but even then…I didn’t feel safe enough to sleep until the sun rose. But I had an even worse experience the next day. I typically kept my closet open cause it made me feel more comfortable but that changed after this. It was around 2PM when I was just watching a movie our teacher had on in zoom…when I sensed movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked over and saw what looked like a woman crawling along the top shelf of my closet. This apparition lasted only for a split second but it scared the living shit out of me. It wasn’t like how they say in these types of stories…she wasn’t transparent, she wasn’t a shadow, she looked like a real living and breathing person crawling at an impossible speed.

But despite the fact that it felt like my soul left and was halfway to hell already after seeing that, I am willing to admit that it could’ve just been from my exhaustion from school and 1 hour sleep. But ever since graduation, it’s felt like something is watching me at night. I can feel its eyes on me as I sleep. And like always, it’s never just the feeling of being watched…it always feels directly threatening. Not a night has gone by once then in my room where I don’t feel like someone or something is standing right above me as I sleep, watching me, threatening me.

For the longest time that’s all it was, but I kept feeling like I was going insane. But I know I’m not, I sleep alone at my mom’s house…and I’m perfectly fine, I feel alone. But it started to get worse when it felt like something started to touch me when I try to sleep. It starts with the feeling of being gazed upon like prey, then as I start to ignore it…it feels like hands slowly gliding down my blanket. The first time it happened, I jumped out of bed thinking someone broke in…only to find my room completely empty. 

Then it started ‘vocalizing’ I think. The first time I heard it was back in August when it sounded like an older man sighed at the foot of my bed, I didn’t dare go back to sleep. The second time it sounded like a woman gasping…and the third time sounded like if an old man imitated a puppy’s yip…right in my ear. I also feel like I hear rummaging in my room at night…occasionally it sounds like a bag is being moved or something.

I’ve dreaded going to sleep every night. So I started bringing my dog Bugsy to bed with me and it seemed to make activity disappear…for about a week. I distinctly remember cuddling up to Bugsy one night…but I couldn’t fall asleep…because I felt Bugsy pitter patter on the foot of my bad…it started imitating my dog. That was its new thing for awhile, the feeling of dog feet walking around my legs. Then I would start hearing Bugsy bark in rooms he wasn’t in…same for my dog Shadow. And it was around this time when Shadow died in his sleep from a random heart attack completely out of nowhere. And I’m terrified that it was a direct threat to me, killing my precious angel for nothing but to threaten me.

Then it started to threaten Bugsy, every night starting after Shadow’s death in October…he’d growl at the closet. This happened for about two weeks until it evolved into Bugsy full on snarling at the closet like it was taunting him. The most recent activity was tonight, that’s why I’m writing this post. I felt the eyes, the threatening presence…but, I tried to ignore it this night…and it wasn’t receptive to that idea. Electricity…it felt like static was running down my back and up my neck all night.

I need help…I need to know what this is and how to get rid of it. Or I fear what it did my dog it’ll do to Bugsy and me.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934878,public,new,self,Possible Haunting,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rhq9fa/possible_haunting/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keep hearing my name being called when trying to sleep, game or listen to music.

Seeing things move and shining out of the corner of my eye. Walking around the home or outside I see faces and outlines of people only for them to suddenly disappear or change into something else when I directly look at it.

Multiple times when away from my PC/headphones sounds like a video or people talking coming from it, only to have no tabs or programs running.

I used to go with him to visit beginning at age 8 or 9 and of course would inevitably go near the cliff and stare down and across.   It was 77 feet from the top of the cliff to a rock floor that a large pond lie about 30 ft. beyond.  If you stood at the top of the cliff looking directly across there was another cliff of equal height and equal distance from the bottom (70 to 77 feet) except at the bottom of that cliff was just the large pond.  No rock floor.  For added effect a two man metal gondola connected to a steel cable and pulley system was installed to allow crossing to the other cliff with the pond 70 some feet below.  I wanted to cross in it but both Dad’s friend and Dad said it hadn’t been used or maintained in years and most likely wasn’t safe.

At age 18 I re-visited the spot with a female acquaintance I’d known for some time.  Snow was everywhere and the pond was moving slowly filled with ice chunks.  Scenic.  The remnants of the gondola were gone.  A decision at some point to remove it.  We sat down near the edge of the cliff and I began to tell the gondola story pointing, gesturing and trying to be clever. 

While talking I looked to my right and saw a long thick piece of metal protruding from the cliff side with a 5 ft. piece of cable still attached left over from the gondola.  It had been an anchor bolt driven 5 ft. deep into the solid rock cliff.  I knew why it was still there because I remember my Dad and his friend attempting to remove it or move it and it wouldn’t budge.

I decided to demonstrate.  I got up and got a firm grip.  I yanked once and the steel rod came out completely.  Unfortunately my weight was leaning backwards and I went off the cliff.  

The moment my feet went airborne my first thought was, “I can’t fall almost 80 ft. and land on my back on rock.”  Somehow I was able to flip over in mid air without touching anything and was now facing forward but had not yet dropped.  But I then immediately DID start to fall which meant I defied gravity.  The cliff wall was completely vertical.  My feet came in contact with the cliff wall and I RAN, not fell but ran down the vertical rock maintaining perfect posture and incredible speed.  Again, gravity should have smashed me into the ground.  It didn’t.

The ground was nearing quickly.  Instead of my ankles breaking when coming in contact I continued to run at the same speed off the cliff and onto the rock floor.  Now looking horizontal I couldn’t slow down or stop.  My legs felt like a detached machine that I couldn’t stop still moving at an inhuman speed.  

I was headed straight toward the pond.  I’d accepted it and said “so be it.”  With one foot of ground left before the pond took over my legs LOCKED and stopped.  My inertia being what it was didn’t stop my upper torso which leaned out over the water while my legs stayed locked into position.  I slowly brought my upper torso in with my legs.  I just stood there.  I wasn’t even out of breath but my heart was pounding.

I turned around and saw my friend looking down at me unblinking and mouth agape.  What I’d just done shouldn’t have happened.  But it did.

The ride home was quiet for several seconds until I said,”How did that happen?”  I laughed and said, “Wow.”  Pause.  She said, “You’re a lucky guy.”  She didn’t look over at me.  She didn’t look at me when I took her home.  She never looked at me again. I think she assigned what she witnessed me do as evil.

Agreed, my body shouldn’t have been able to defy gravity but it did.  I assign it as neither good or evil.

I returned with my wife at age 24 for a visit with my family.   I was anxious to share with her the different locations I’d grown up with. 

The year was 1979.  After a full day of visiting old haunts (no pun intended) we exited a break in a wooded area and were greeted with the site of the old Winston Hospital.  I was familiar with it as it was the place that treated my foot laceration at age 9 and my broken ankle at age 14.  Except it was obvious the hospital had long been closed.  It hadn’t been a new building the two times that I frequented it.  But now it looked large, desolate and creepy.

I proceeded to fill my wife in on my times being there.  It was approaching dusk.  We had a Polaroid One Step camera.  I started taking pics.  About four.  3 from the front (opposite side from us) and one of the back (where we were facing).  The photos developed and ejected within 70 seconds.  But the camera operator of these instant photos were always instructed to not touch them other than along the neutral white borders because the photo continued to develop for several minutes after ejection.  We stood around for awhile talking then bagged the completed developed photos and left.

The photos were viewed about one month later with friends after arriving home.  When the hospital photo was revealed the 3 photos taken in front were perfect.  The 1 photo at the back?  Surprising and creepy.

The back of the hospital facing the woods we exited was 6 stories tall and not one pane of glass in any.  The window openings were evenly spaced on every floor.  In the photo there were now semi illuminated figures of people shaped figures in the widows.  Two in some, tree in a few a one in the majority.  There was no mistaking their shape.  With the exception of a few all of the widows had an image in it.  Floors 3 and 4 had the most.  4 through 6 as well except all windows only showed a single figure.

We were stunned.  Our friends made ghost sounds and laughed and the conversation continued as they rummaged through the remaining  photos.  My wife and I just looked at each other in stunned silence.

After everyone left we examined the photo again.  It was unmistakeable.  We ruled out camera or lighting fault simply due to the figures.  They varied in height and positioning as people would do if standing at a window.  We’d gotten a ghost photo.

My biggest regret?  My wife asked me to burn it.  Not tear it up and throw away but to burn it.  She associated the image with evil.  I didn’t.  She continued with her insistence throughout the week and as she watched I burnt the photo until it was ashes.

Had it been 2021 and not 1979 I could have sent it to Reddit, Polaroid, TikToc, the Internet and all of the now too familiar paranormal shows on the tube.  But it wasn’t - and I couldn’t.  But I had it.  The ghost photo extraordinaire.

Please forgive my possibility bad English, or strange way of writing, I'm not a native speaker. 
I'm 23 and cannabis addicted since a couple of years. I can pretend to be able to life my own life which means I go to work, earn my own money and can pay my stuff. I think I'm not really 'confused' of my consume or so. 

This happened around a half year ago. 
I bought pot for 20 bucks and went home and put my whole stuff like keys, wallet and weed out of my pockets on my couch, before I change my clothes and go to the bathroom for taking a shower. This is my everyday routine when I come home.  Go into the living room,  throw my stuff on my couch and go to the bathroom. Every day. 
This day I came out of the bathroom and wanted to roll a joint. So I sit on my couch, turn on the tv and grab for my weed in the corner of the couch without looking to it just to feel my keys and wallet, but not my weed

There is not really a way to fall on the ground, but I got two cats, and even if they never touched my weed baggies, I looked for it in the whole flat, especially under and around my couch. It flipped me out, but it can't be found this evening. 

2 days later I changed the water bowl for my cats and I found the baggy under it. 
It totally flipped me out to find it at this place, because the water bowl is at the other side of the room and  I change it every day so I must seem it before. I'm also really sure my cats are not able to move the bowl. 
There is no logical explanation for me. Also I had two visitors in this week who saw how I put my stuff on my couch. They can't believe it too, when i found it totally out of place.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934841,public,new,self,I lost my weed and found it absolutely out of place,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rhmz6b/i_lost_my_weed_and_found_it_absolutely_out_of/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We often go to the Cottonwood Disc Golf course to eat and play, as it's been a very comfortable, convenient place to do so. But within the past month or so, we've experienced a lot of weird and scary things that make us not want to go back alone.

The first thing we both experienced was honestly the most horrifying night of my life. We went to the park to eat some calzones and relax, as per usual, however the area, although lit normally, seemed darker than usual, and 100% silent. My partner then felt very very odd and watched, and locked the doors without saying a word. Eventually, they spotted some kind of fabric in the right mirror, outside the car, flapping around. Feeling immediately unsettled, they tried to focus on other things. I was oblivious to the entirety of this, until I saw the same piece of fabric flapping outside as well, and a wave of INTENSE dread and unease washed over me. Without questioning a thing, we drove away as fast as we could. 

The feeling didn't leave until the next morning though, and we drove for multiple hours to try and avoid it, even driving close to downtown, which was the only thing that made it feel even slightly better, until we left the area again. We felt watched within our bedroom the entire night afterwards. Eventually, while thinking on the experience, they got what they described as a ""flash"" of the creature's face, and we're too frightened to describe it.

A couple weeks later, after calming down from the adventure, I had seen a very tall, pale yet dark skinned creature, almost as if it were oily. It had concerningly long arms, and looked. Somehow rough? It's difficult to explain. I too got a flash of it's face while driving away, which was highly unsettling. But my partner didn't seem to notice, so I kept quiet about the whole thing. And just tonight, while disc golfing, they saw some sort of long armed humanoid watching us from the darkness of the woods surrounding us. And we finally discussed our individual faces we saw, and the descriptions matched exactly. A pale face with dark eyes, a wide mouth that could be understood as ""smiling"", with bits of skin connecting the top and bottom lips, and a ""rough"" but oily complexion. 

We're mostly posting this to find out more information on it, as no post we've seen has matched our description exactly, and we want to know if anyone has seen something at this park, or has had similar experiences.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934834,public,new,self,Creature stalking Cottonwood Park (CO),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rhmf4v/creature_stalking_cottonwood_park_co/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been evaluated for Schizophrenia before and been cleared as “normal”. It’s never really been a thing until my roommate has been noticing its presence. Like, we’ll be watching TV and my roommate will go “oh your friend is here”, and gesture to wherever this being is hanging out. My roommate isn’t afraid of whatever this is, he’s just aware of it being there. 

Sometimes it even tells me about future events. My sister’s birthday was recently and I heard a “congrats on the promotion” out of nowhere from this thing. My family and I don’t really talk, and it’s been about a month since I spoke to my sister. But I did text her to wish her a happy birthday and a congrats on the promotion because I figured it was something I had seen on social media and forgot about. She was confused and said she hadn’t been promoted. After she got off work though, she messaged me to tell me that she had been promoted to junior supervisor. 

At this point, I’m just wondering what is attached to me. My roommate who can “feel” this entity says it’s probably just a guide. My other roommate thinks it’s a deity, which I doubt. I just always figured it was either me being crazy or just a spirit that had passed on and attached itself to me for whatever reason. 

If it matters, in my mind’s eye, it takes the shape of a spindly, tall black/grey figure sometimes. But usually presents in a more approachable fashion. Like a male of my own age. It’s got a pretty sharp sense of humor, too. At this point it just feels like a sassy imaginary friend. I just wanted to see if anyone might know what this is. 

Thank you in advance! I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense. It’s a hard thing to describe.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934805,public,new,self,Entity hanging around me,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rhkkug/entity_hanging_around_me/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For reference, we live in a small town of about 4,500 people in southwestern Wisconsin. Our house (the scene of the sighting) is situated in the more-industrial side of town, although there are other houses close by; but there are also woods and vacant lots.

One August evening, around 8 p.m., Sofie, her younger sister, and a friend were sitting in a bedroom they share on the ground floor of this house. Suddenly, an exterior door in the laundry room (which is adjacent to the bedroom) flew open abruptly, without an accompanying wind gust. There was no one outside (Sofie checked). About 15 minutes later, the door spontaneously flew open again. The friend went to close to door. 

Another 20 minutes passed, and Sofie went to the laundry room. She heard a noise from the door. The door swung open, and Sofie swears she saw an approximately 3' tall hairless possum-like creature standing hunched in the doorway.

i was standing on the second floor balcony area of my classroom, and was speaking to my classmate when this happened. it felt like it was something i wasn’t supposed to see. and at that age, a lot of things ran through my mind right after seeing it appear and immediately disappear right before my eyes. my classmate and i never spoke about it after we both witnessed it, and just asked each other right after that moment “did you see that too?” and we both gave each other a straight faced answer “yes.” 

a lot went through our minds right after, and being that age and having a short attention span, we never revisited that image of what we saw again. until recently when we reconnected. 

now both at 26 years old, we wonder if there has been any similar instances of this happening to anyone out there? i know for sure it wasn’t my imagination, or a shared hallucination between both me and my then classmate.

I remember shutting the door quietly so I would not wake him up cause he spent the whole day working the day before then. I decided to clean up my room to pass the time and when I was moving my toys to the shelf I felt something pull my shirt and I turned around there was nothing! Keep in mind I’m 5 years old in this story I say “what was that”, and then my tv started flickering turning on and off, and I got frightened by this I went running to wake up my dad. I told him i felt something grab me and saw my tv flickering he immediately got up. I took him to the place were it happened and he asked  me questions about what happened I told him every detail and he said my great grandmother use to do that to him when she was still here.

This is my first post and I am on mobile so please disregard any spelling errors. 

Something you should know is that I am a firm believer (as well as most of my family) in all things paranormal and have had a many experiences myself with the paranormal but, it has become so common in my life I don't really get scared. Something else you should know I live in the middle of nowhere, quite literally, I live on a private road, in the middle of a field, the road is about a mile long until I have a neighbor, and the nearest Walmart is about 45 minutes away. I have only lived in this house for about 4 years, but this is relevant to the story I promise.

I have 3 younger sisters and all of them get spooked very easily. We have had a lot of unexplainable experiences such as, I had the room that had a window that faced the walkway up to my house, I would often hear noises like people talking outside my window when my parents and siblings were asleep but, I brushed it off as the outside cats we have. One summer night I had my bedroom window cracked open as my room tended to get extremely hot, and I heard something scratching at my window, I got freaked out and my first instinct was to lay flat so whatever was outside my window wouldn't see me in my bed. I laid flat for what felt like 30 minutes, but was probably only 1 or 2 minutes. When I finally got the courage to look, it was just one of the outside cats, so I hopped out of bed to shoo her away and shut the window. About a year later me and my sister switched bedrooms, at this point the outside cat who scratches at the window screen had passed away. One night my sister comes running into my room, very pale and says ""There's someone scratching at my window"". My first thought is ""No it's just the cat"" but then I remembered she has passed. I get really freaked out and tell her it is okay and not to worry about it, just to come sit with me for a bit and it was probably just the videos she is always watching getting to her head. After a while I telm her I'll go check it out because at this point it was late and I really wanted to go to bed and figured maybe it was just a windy night and she was freaking herself out for no reason. I went to go stand in her room and I hear or see nothing at her window, I stand there for a bit longer still, nothing. As I turn around I hear the scratching. I froze. I turned around and looked directly at a shadow of what looked like a man in the window. I just stared for a second, it felt worse than the other paranormal experiences I had, it felt bad like I wasn't supposed to be there, like there was bad intentions from this shadow. After I realized this wasn't good I ran to my bedroom and picked up my sister, ran to my other sisters room and told her to come with me. I went to open my parents door but it was locked so I started banging on the door, luckily my father is a pretty light sleeper and heard us trying to open the door so was up and at the door before I started screaming, he asked what was wrong and I said there was someone at my little sisters window. He immediately grabbed his gun and was out the door. After my dad walked around the whole house and made sure no one was outside, he checked the security cameras and showed me there was no one there. I kept telling him, I saw it, there was someone there. He told me it was late and to go to bed but I couldn't sleep. I was terrified about what I saw and the feeling it gave me. My sister slept in my room that night and the next night.

In the next 3 years there was the normal amount of paranormal stuff. Footsteps, thinking I heard my name before I was about to sleep, power surging in only one room for no reason (maybe bad wiring), seeing shadows that were unexplainable.. Up until about last month that was the normal. 

Now for the events that occured. I had a ghost in my room who would tug at my hair. But besides that, never bothered me much. One day I was extremely upset, and there goes the ghost, tugging at my hair, I yelled and screamed and told them to stop playing with me and to just go away. The next few days were extremely quite, nothing from the ghost in my room. I knew I accidently banished him from my room, but I didn't care too much as they were kinda annoying and gave me a bad feeling sometimes, probably not a spirit with my best interest in mind. About a week later my parents went down the street with my little sisters to play poker with my grandparents. When I got off work I went down there to pick them up cuz I was their DDD (Designated Drunk Driver), when I arrived my dad told me he hadn't been drinking and was okay to drive so I could go home and go to sleep. I have a dog named Maverick and and I got home he was so excited to see me as dogs do. When I went to my bedroom to lay down I feel like something was watching me out my window. I didn't think much of it because I believe we have a ghost in our kitchen so it was probably that ghost paired with the fact it was dark and I was home alone. I layed down and so did Maverick, I heard a car pull into the driveway and the doors slam. They took my moms car and it has very squeaky heavy doors that are hard to miss. I was expecting them to walk into the house any minute. But 5 minutes passed and the front door hadn't opened yet.  Then Maverick started flipping out, I'm talking about growling, barking, the hair on his back stood up. This is the first time I've ever seen him growl. He is a loud dog that barks all the time (I like to say he has lots of opinions), but after this he has only growled once and it was at some random guy who tried to pet him in a store while I wasn't paying attention. That only happened recently. I opened my bedroom door thinking he was being over dramatic at my parents but no one was home. No car in the drive way, no one in the house.  He continued to flip out at the front door, barking and growling like he was about to fight for his life. I immediately got that bad feeling I had when that shadow was in my sisters window. So I picked up Maverick (who is still flipping out, and also weighs 80 pounds) and take him to my room. I lock the door and call my mother and ask her where she is and she says she is still down the street and that they will be home in 5 minutes. Maverick is still freaking out and I hear someone running in the hallway, loud, angry footsteps. My bedroom door begins to shake like someone is trying to get in. I began crying and called my mom again. She said they were coming down our road now. Then I hear the front door open, the door stops shaking, and my mom knocks she says ""mija, we are home."" At this point I'm too scared to open the door. I sat on the floor crying. I didn't want to open it. She knocked and said again ""we are home."" Then I hear my sisters and dad, Maverick stop growling and now is excited to see who is here. I opened the door and it was my mom. I cried on her shoulder and told her I was so scared. Then we went to check the security cameras to see who was in the house. My dad showed me, no one was there. We were also missing half of the footage for some reason but what was there showed no one. I kept insisting and they kept telling me the cameras have the footage. My father isn't much of a believer but my mother is, and when I told her, she was just as spooked as I was.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934671,public,new,self,I accidently banished the ghost in my room and they made it very clear they are upset.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rh9m5f/i_accidently_banished_the_ghost_in_my_room_and/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My family will be moving cross country in the next 6 months or so. Because the market is doing so well, we probably will have to buy a home without seeing it in person. I grew up in a home that was haunted - my mom did witchcraft, the Ouija board and conjured spirits. It was very scary to say the least. I’ve always been very intuitive when it comes to spirits and knowing when someone is present, so moving into my current home it was important for me to be inside and feel the energy. I guess my question is, how can I know if anyone is haunted or has bad energy before moving into it? I’d hate to move across the country with my family only to feel uncomfortable and scared in my own home.

(Also sorry if my english is off, it's not my first language).

So a few years ago I was sitting on the edge of my bed in the middle of the night. I was the only one awake. First I heard a skratching sound by the top corner of my room, beside the door. It startled me but I ignored the experience, made me a little paranoid. An hour later I heard three knocks on my door (like someone tapped the door with their finger). At the time I thought it was my mother coming to tell me to go to sleep (she used to do that but opens the door after knocking but this time the door never opened). I also found it odd that not only she didn't open the door but she didn't even say anything. At this point I was frozen in fear and made me very aware how quiet it was (in the house). I also never heard footsteps walking away from my room or towards my room. (I'd also like to point out that my house is very old and you can hear very well if someone is walking). 

I asked my mother the next day if she had knocked on my door, but she said she didn't.

Personally, I'm very creeped out by this still, years later, and my house has always creeped me out and it still is. 

My boyfriend has also confirmed the creepy aura it gives of as well as my sister having creepy experiences in the same corner of the room.

In the beginning, we couldn’t find the entrance and as we walked around the building I began to feel somewhat sick to my stomach almost as if I had to use the restroom and couldn’t hold it. (I’m 25 and never had this issue). We finally found a side entrance double-door that had been sealed off with wood stapled down the middle. We had ripped it apart and was able to pull the doors open to go inside, then shut the doors behind us to avoid others coming in and possibly scaring us. It is a total of 6 floors  with a basement included and an elevator that no longer functioned. 


As we began walking I still had that very ill sensation as if I couldn’t bare to hold what was inside me. We started exploring and it just got worse. I finally parted ways and went to a private sector where I actually had to use the restroom and used both #1 and #2s. (Disgusting, I know I’m ashamed). Not sure what got into me but it’s as if I just lost control of my own CONTROL to hold it in. I don’t know if the nerves inside me or anxiety set me off, but regardless I did it inside the hospital. We ended up exploring the entire building, from the basement where the morgue was to the 6th floor. Had some parts where there were needles, used fluid bags and other prior hospital utilities that should of definitely been thrown away before closing out. 


Finally (2 hours and 10 mins later) we left the building and I overall felt a sense of relief. The very next day, in my house, around 12:51am I remember something in my garage (right next to me as my room is by the basement) I heard a LOUD noise and my first reaction was that my husky was inside and I texted my sister to come downstairs. She asked what I wanted and I asked if Sophie (our husky) was inside and she said no, so I’m like “oh okay, well I heard a loud noise in the garage” and she was hesitant on looking but finally did. She found something next to her cage, some sort of sock, draws, and other stuff; a plastic container with 3 paralleled storages from down to up, had been knocked down. It had all 4 wheels, nothing on top, it just went about a foot away from the cage it was next to. We were kind of like, oh okay? We didn’t know what exactly could of caused it. Definitely not wind as there is none. We haven’t had mice in over a year at this point (used to have a bad mice issue) And even if we did, the force in which it was knocked, there’s no way something as small as a mice could do that. 



First incident. The next, about 3-5 days later, my sister is upstairs in our living room that’s closer to our back yard, up at 1am messaging her friend. As she’s replying with a VOICE message we actually have saved, she heard a loud thump/ball noise, almost as if a ping pong ball bounced off something but a bit louder, just random noise coming from a section of the room where she claims nothing fell to have made a noise. 



Third incident, my mom tells me a few days later she was up at 5am and heard from my room loud thump noises, she claims it sounded like I was going up the stairs…
I was NOT even home that morning/night she heard it as I stayed at my girlfriends house.  So I’m like starting to think, is there some kind of ghost or something that’s making this stuff happen or what’s going on, cause I remembered this started happening the day after the hospital visit.



Fourth incident, I was upstairs in my sisters room with my cat and I was just playing with him and out of nowhere something behind me (a window ledge that you place on top as a decor or for looks) had slid and fell back, it’s approximately 6-7 feet tall and it was placed against the wall and my sister claims the way it was placed no way it could of fell without it getting pushed. As it had about a 65-70 degree angle towards the wall, gravity definitely would keep it stable from falling back. So at this point I’m like okay, what’s going on…. Told my sister about the restroom incident she thinks we need to cleanse our house LOL.
Nope, not done yet.. 



Fifth incident, I’m at my girlfriends house and my sister is texting me at 12:30am or some super late time. She sends me video of my kitten being super weird and staring off into a certain part of the living room (same one she heard the noise). She sends ANOTHER video and this is where it gets spooky, asher lays down and as soon as he starts looking away THE NOISE is heard again and even Asher heard it as it scared him and made him look toward the direction of the ceiling/corner of the wall where it seemed to have came from.
So now, I’m like okay….. somethings up. But I haven’t done anything yet, haven’t tried cleansing or anything. 



The last incident that happened probably about a month ago, I was laying sleeping in bed and above me there’s this joker wooden framed picture that’s placed directly center of my bed about 6-10 inches above my head and 2-3 inches away from it. I WOKE up the next day with the PICTURE which is roughly 1.5ft width and 2ft in height, was directly NEXT to my bad in between the cat tower I have and the bed, and it was upside down…..
 


I could not believe it, for the life of me I just couldn’t. I kept thinking, how did it not wake me up if it fell? The nail in the wall was definitely not right and I could see how it fell as I placed it back, but every time it fell (3-4 times) it fell right behind the bed as there was a very small space for it to fit, so I don’t know how it ended up next to me and upside down.

Since then, nothing unusual has happened besides the garage item falling again, but something was placed above it and we think it had something to do with it unlike last. 
My kitten also acts crazy around 12-1am but it’s normal from what googles says.
But these incidents are freaky and I have the sound recordings for both and videos as well of my kitten. 



Any suggestions on what is partaking? Is it just my consciousness playing tricks, am I just trying to believe something that isn’t there, is?

I've had two events occur in it however.

The first one happened a few months ago; my parents were out of town and therefore I was the only one home. I was upstairs in my room when I suddenly heard multiple doors repeatedly opening and closing in the downstairs area. I went to check, and as soon as I did, the constant noise of opening and closing of doors ended. All the windows were closed shut so the wind couldn't have possibly caused that, which it wouldn't even explain how the doors could slam open and then shut.

Second event (or events) occured twice during two consecutive nights, at around 1am each time. I would hear footsteps, loud and clear, coming from the kitchen for awhile, then they would get closer to my door— my door would slowly open, and nobody would stand in the dark doorway/hallway, while all footsteps stopped entirely. Each time I got up (yes, I would be the first one to die in a horror movie) to check if my parents were awake; but they would be asleep in their bedroom downstairs, hence I was, once again, all on my own to experience this stuff. 
I was really scared the first night, and actually hesitated a bit to get up and see, but during the second night, I was more annoyed than scared. I told whatever spirit there was to stop bothering me, and it surprisingly did stop.

Well two experiences to be exact. I was asleep and was not aware I was dreaming for some reason. In front of my eye sight was my bedroom door and the hallway where a sliver of light came into my dark room. I felt afraid and knew that my boyfriend was in the living room at the far side of the house. 

I dedieded to get up and out of bed and I was in a hurry because I was afraid. When I ran through the hallway and got to the living room the house changed around me in an instant. Everything was dark and it didn't look like my home anymore. 

I started to float up and backwards towards my body that lay in my bed. There was a shadow figure that approached me in a threatening way. I was fighting to keep it away from me. I don't know what it's aim was but it definitely was to harm me in some way. It felt like it was trying to overpower me. 

When I was finished floating backwards and was slammed into my body I was back in my dark bedroom afraid. The shadow was still there in the room with me. I tried to force my eyes awake or cry out but I couldn't. It took about 3 minutes to fully awaken. 

After calming down I eventually went back to sleep feeling afraid of it happening again. I don't experience sleep paralysis often, but when I do it happens more than once in that same night. 

I fell asleep and suddenly I was fighting against the shadow figure once again. It was on top of me in my bed and there was a struggle. It felt like it was trying to enter me. That's the only reason I can think of that it would be coming so close but not hurting me. I fought it off and battled the sleep paralysis again for a couple minutes and then awoke disturbed. 

I then calmed myself down again and fell back asleep. I had a very vivid dream of playing with a Ouija board and when I placed my hands on the planchette, it moved with fierceness. It was powerful. Thats all I remember.

Now here's the kicker. I've never experienced a shadow figure before in my life. This is the second time it's happened. Me and my friend used one of my two ouija boards in the spare room in my apartment about a month ago and contacted a spirit named “mama"". I'm told that it is a malevolent spirit that causes chaos and harm.

We were playing with the ouija board for a few minutes when it just started going to mamamamama. I looked up and asked her if she was moving it. She asked me if I was moving it. We both said we weren't. We then just decided to say goodbye because that's all it was saying. 

Initially we thought the board was talking about my friend's mother. She had problems recently with her mom and they always fight. So we chalked it up as nothing and time went on. 

I researched mama and apparently it's a different name for the ouija demon zozo. I had no idea and felt a little bit disturbed by this. Because there was no activity going on in my house or at my friend's I thought we had sucessfully ended the session with the ouija board and then spirit didn't come through to stay. 

But about a week ago I called my friend. We talk slot on the phone and are really close. She told me that her daughter had a really bad experience the night before. Apparently she was in her room and woke up to a shadow figure standing in her room. Her daughter said it spoke to her. When she went to ask her daughter what it said her daughter burst into tears. She said that the shadow said,”we found you"". 

I don't know if there is any connection to any of this but it's kind of jarring. Any opinions are welcome in the comments.

In the beginning, we couldn’t find the entrance and as we walked around the building I began to feel somewhat sick to my stomach almost as if I had to use the restroom and couldn’t hold it. (I’m 25 and never had this issue). We finally found a side entrance double-door that had been sealed off with wood stapled down the middle. We had ripped it apart and was able to pull the doors open to go inside, then shut the doors behind us to avoid others coming in and possibly scaring us. It is a total of 6 floors  with a basement included and an elevator that no longer functioned. As we began walking I still had that very ill sensation as if I couldn’t bare to hold what was inside me. We started exploring and it just got worse. I finally parted ways and went to a private sector where I actually had to use the restroom and used both #1 and #2s. (Disgusting, I know I’m ashamed). Not sure what got into me but it’s as if I just lost control of my own CONTROL to hold it in. I don’t know if the nerves inside me or anxiety set me off, but regardless I did it inside the hospital. We ended up exploring the entire building, from the basement where the morgue was to the 6th floor. Had some parts where there were needles, used fluid bags and other prior hospital utilities that should of definitely been thrown away before closing out. We finally (2 hours and 10 mins later) left the building and I overall felt a sense of relief. The very next day, in my house, around 12:51am I remember something in my garage (right next to me as my room is by the basement) I heard a LOUD noise and my first reaction was that my husky was inside and I texted my sister to come downstairs. She asked what I wanted and I asked if Sophie (our husky) was inside and she said no, so I’m like “oh okay, well I heard a loud noise in the garage” and she was hesitant on looking but finally did. She found something next to her cage, some sort of sock, draws, and other stuff; a plastic container with 3 paralleled storages from down to up, had been knocked down. It had all 4 wheels, nothing on top, it just went about a foot away from the cage it was next to. We were kind of like, oh okay? We didn’t know what exactly could of caused it. Definitely not wind as there is none. We haven’t had mice in over a year at this point (used to have a bad mice issue) And even if we did, the force in which it was knocked, there’s no way something as small as a mice could do that. 
First incident. The next, about 3-5 days later, my sister is upstairs in our living room that’s closer to our back yard, up at 1am messaging her friend. As she’s replying with a VOICE message we actually have saved, she heard a loud thump/ball noise, almost as if a ping pong ball bounced off something but a bit louder, just random noise coming from a section of the room where she claims nothing fell to have made a noise. 
Third incident, my mom tells me a few days later she was up at 5am and heard from my room loud thump noises, she claims it sounded like I was going up the stairs…
I was NOT even home that morning/night she heard it as I stayed at my girlfriends house.  So I’m like starting to think, is there some kind of ghost or something that’s making this stuff happen or what’s going on, cause I remembered this started happening the day after the hospital visit.
Fourth incident, I was upstairs in my sisters room with my cat and I was just playing with him and out of nowhere something behind me (a window ledge that you place on top as a decor or for looks) had slid and fell back, it’s approximately 6-7 feet tall and it was placed against the wall and my sister claims the way it was placed no way it could of fell without it getting pushed. As it had about a 65-70 degree angle towards the wall, gravity definitely would keep it stable from falling back. So at this point I’m like okay, what’s going on…. Told my sister about the restroom incident she thinks we need to cleanse our house LOL.
Nope, not done yet.. fifth incident, I’m at my girlfriends house and my sister is texting me at 12:30am or some super late time. She sends me video of my kitten being super weird and staring off into a certain part of the living room (same one she heard the noise). She sends ANOTHER video and this is where it gets spooky, asher lays down and as soon as he starts looking away THE NOISE is heard again and even Asher heard it as it scared him and made him look toward the direction of the ceiling/corner of the wall where it seemed to have came from.
So now, I’m like okay….. somethings up. But I haven’t done anything yet, haven’t tried cleansing or anything. The last incident that happened probably about a month ago, I was laying sleeping in bed and above me there’s this joker wooden framed picture that’s placed directly center of my bed about 6-10 inches above my head and 2-3 inches away from it. I WOKE up the next day with the PICTURE which is roughly 1.5ft width and 2ft in height, was directly NEXT to my bad in between the cat tower I have and the bed, and it was upside down…..
 I could not believe it, for the life of me I just couldn’t. I kept thinking, how did it not wake me up if it fell? The nail in the wall was definitely not right and I could see how it fell as I placed it back, but every time it fell (3-4 times) it fell right behind the bed as there was a very small space for it to fit, so I don’t know how it ended up next to me and upside down.

Since then, nothing unusual has happened besides the garage item falling again, but something was placed above it and we think it had something to do with it unlike last. 
My kitten also acts crazy around 12-1am but it’s normal from what googles says.

But these incidents are freaky and I have the sound recordings for both and videos as well of my kitten. 

Any suggestions on what is partaking? Is it just my consciousness playing tricks, am I just trying to believe something that isn’t there, is?

By the time I was in my twenties I was no longer a believer. Come my early thirties and I flip flopped again to being a believer. My best friend had been living in a house with his girlfriend for a few months until they had a big blowout/fight and she moved out. I had just started a new job and needed a cheap place to stay until I saved up some cash to get my own place. At that time in my life I was in a dark place and was self medicating pretty heavily. My friend was doing the same (plus he was the local supplier of party favors) so it was a perfect match. He had mentioned that a few weird things had happened in the 3 months he had been staying there, but I just chalked it up to him being drunk. So the first night I was there he was out of town for the weekend. It was just myself and his two dogs. I was exhausted from moving all day and went to bed pretty early. I wasn’t drinking or messing with the devils dandruff. Stone cold sober. As I was lying in bed, starting to drift off to sleep, I heard someone yell my name. It sounded like it was right next in my ear. It freaked me out but I figured I was half asleep and starting to dream. One of the dogs he had was a huge Rottweiler. Like 150lbs huge. So I had him come sleep on my floor and the rest of the night was uneventful. About a week later my friend and I went to our local watering hole. The town we lived in wasn’t small, but it was the kind of place where everyone knew everyone, especially at the local bars. So my buddy is telling a story about him and his (now ex) girlfriend having a weird experience. They had been grilling out and were sitting down to watch tv. He had just grabbed a couple of beers and walked backed into the family room when he heard a bottle cap hit the floor in the kitchen. He went back into the kitchen and saw the bottle cap in the middle of the floor. He said he had left it on the counter, nowhere near the edge. No windows were open so a gust of wind didn’t blow it off. It was as if someone flicked it off the counter and onto the floor. Well the guy sitting next to us had heard our conversation and we had mentioned the street/neighborhood/area we lived. He proceeds to tell us that the house we were living in had a fire a few years ago. There was an elderly couple who lived there and the wife was a heavy drinker/smoker. One night she passed out smoking a cigarette and dropped it on her recliner. The family room went up in flames and she passed away right there. The husband died in the ambulance. Needless to say we were pretty shocked to hear this. So last call rolls around and we head home with a few people for some after hours partying. As we are sitting there telling the story we had just heard, all the smoke detectors start going off. The hair on the back of my neck stood straight up. I’m convinced the spirit of the old lady was there with us. Creepy stuff like that happened a few more times and it was always late at night when we were drinking. I like to think the old lady was there with us, having a couple cold ones. Nothing  malevolent ever happened.

I'm not so fuckin sure I believe myself either. Anyways, onto the ghost (?) bullshit. 

I woke up yesterday night fuckin soaked in sweat from the heater I'd set up in my bedroom and went into the bathroom. I stuck my face under the water in the sink and heard an odd tapping noise coming from behind the mirror. Thinking it was a mouse/rat chilling in the walls (as I don't live in the best place and the mice ought to pay rent at this point), I didn't think much of it and dried my face off on a hand towel, going back to bed. Whether it was the noise behind the mirror or just the feeling like I was being watched after that, I couldn't sleep. Either way, I assumed it was the mirror and went to the mirror to further investigate that shit. After thoroughly inspecting the mirror itself, I pressed my ear to the wall and heard the wildest noise. Faint whispering. I couldn't make out a single word of it, but it was incredibly distinctive, sounding just garbled, like the person (?) talking's mouth was full of fucking spit. I had stepped back and rightly freaked the fuck out, banging on the wall next to the mirror and asking who was in there. 

In response, however, much to my surprise, I got several other bangs back, the mirror shaking with the force of them. In turn, I ran out of the bathroom and into the living room, grabbing my phone and wallet, before hearing another series of knocks on the wall in the living room and one clear muffled yell of a sentence. ""Please stop."" I, regretfully, nearly goddamn shit my pants and yelled at it to leave me alone, running out the front door and down the sidewalk over to my neighbor's house, banging on his door and telling him that I had found another spiders nest under my bed (which has happened before), and he let me in, letting me sleep on his couch.

 I've never been more fucking scared in my life and I'm really not sure what to do now. Selling the house and living at my friend's (who I'm staying with now) until I find a new place is the current plan. But, I'm really not sure.

I would still have to go back and pack up my stuff if I did go and I've lived in that house comfortably for two weeks with no problems like this, so I'm not sure if I'm ready to leave that all behind because of one little in incident like this that could've just been some surreal sort of nightmare.

The  human mind is able to hallucinate for various reasons as in mental  episodes, drugs, etc. We also see things that do not exist when we  dream. So there is obviously a part of the brain that can ""overlay""  non-physical entities onto our very real visual plane.

So  what if ghosts aren't in fact ""real"", as in existing in our physical  world, but rather an entity that exists in another dimension entirely,  and can manifest itself by means of stimulating this part of the brain?

Many  people, very credible people, have seen ghosts, but none have ever been  captured on film, many ""spirit photos"" being easily provable fakes. But  a camera can only see the physical world, so if this manifestation  exists as in a induced hallucination, a camera will never see it.

Now  you are going to probably ask me next, well then how do you explain  ghosts moving objects? Simple, it's a form of energy. Just like radio  waves, we cannot see them, but know they are there.

If  your physical reality is shown to your brain through electrical  activity from dendrites and axons, then perhaps a ghost can not only  manipulate the electrical ""signal"" to show itself, it can also  manipulate physical properties into moving.

Our  conscious is there, present in our bodies until death, but our physical  properties are very much still present. So this might allude to my  personal theory that the human consciousness is also a form of energy,  of which can neither be created nor destroyed.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934501,public,new,self,Could ghosts be a non-physical entity capable of inducing hallucination?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rgsaqa/could_ghosts_be_a_nonphysical_entity_capable_of/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dengue one was kinda weird as my temperature went straight from 97 to 106 and doctors said it is rare that it got so high in such a small period. Also within 5 days, I was completely fine with platelets increasing. She also had a miscarriage and sometimes sees a naked child asking for clothes in her dreams. Also, two incidents happened with my elder brother who lives here with us. During lockdown last year he was alone in a room on the floor above and saw a very black figure and when he approached it the figure launched him onto a table. The next thing he remembers is waking up on the bed on the floor below and thinking it was a dream which felt very real but the thing is he had immense pain and bruising in his back for about a week. The second incident was my brother dreaming about another cousin who committed suicide in 2018. In his dream, he was asked where his elder sister is and what is she doing. He answered it and the next week his sister tells him about dreaming of the deceased cousin. Can any of you help me regarding what it can be and why is it happening?

I would only stay with him during school holidays and the house had a somewhat uncomfortable vibe but I always put it down to my dad being quite volatile and him fighting with his wife a lot.

Anyway my first experience was the dimmer on the lights in my room going crazy. It would always be when everyone else was in bed and at first I thought it was dodgy lights until I saw the marker on the dimmer actually moving back and forward. Scared the crap out of me at the time so I flicked the lights off and tried to go to sleep, then the knocking started. I'd hear the lightest tap tap tap on the wall above my head. It would stop for about half an hour then start again. Sometimes I'd tap and get a tap back. This only happened for a couple of weeks over one holiday. 

The next holiday I had a friend stay with me. We were up late talking rubbish in the bedroom with door closed so as to not wake my dad, then suddenly the bedroom door flew open with force. I jumped up and checked the hall but nobody was there and all the other bedroom doors were shut. I was scared but shut the door and turned to my friend and said it must have been a random breeze, then it happened again 10 mins later. We didn't really sleep much that night but nothing else happened.

I'm not sure if it was an entity or energy in the house, I've heard that poltergeists can be attracted to teens but thankfully whatever it was never followed us out of that house!

My family and I moved here back in July of 2018, and this is the first time we’ve experienced something paranormal in this house. We didn’t think there was anything in this house because every single house we’ve lived in previously, something always happened, and those entities were never friendly.

This time around, I’m quite relieved our ghost friend is.

**Here’s context before I dive into the story:**

Before my parents bought the house we currently live in, there was a family that was renting the house. The previous tenants had a son who was in the military, I can’t remember which branch, but he unfortunately passed away overseas. His wife and child were living with his parents and his family was still grieving his passing as it was recent. 

I have three younger siblings: J (male), L (male), and V (female). We all still live with our parents, who haven’t experienced anything in the house yet. My brother J’s girlfriend, who I’ll refer to as SIL, recently moved in with us and they sleep in the room where the soldier’s wife and kid slept (according to what my mom told me).

My family at the time had 4 dogs: Lola, a pithuahua; Kovu, a German Shepherd; Daisy, a Malinois; and Chico, an applehead chihuahua. Lola is my sister V’s dog, Kovu is my brother J’s dog, and Daisy and Chico are my parents’ dogs. I have two cats, Shadow and Sin Nombre. Daisy had puppies two months prior; the adult dogs and the cats were with me.

Daisy’s puppies slept in a room which I’ll refer to as the laundry room, but technically is more of a second, bigger living room. There are three ways to get into the laundry room: through the house, back door, or the sliding door facing the front of the house where we park our cars.

**Now to the story:**

The day I heard the knocking, SIL texted me in the morning at 8:46 to ask if I had knocked on her and J’s room. I texted back no and that her text had woken me up. L was still in his room, talking to his girlfriend. Once I got up and went to the living room, she explained that literally 5 minutes before she texted me, she was falling back asleep when she clearly heard someone knocking on her door.

She got up to answer and no one was there.

L then started saying how two weeks prior, our dad had told him to lock the front door before he went to sleep. He agreed, said he would do it and went back to what he was doing. L accidentally fell asleep, and he said someone whispered “The front door” right next to his ear. He first thought he imagined it, but Kovu was in his room also sleeping, and he also raised his head and looked around the room like he heard the whisper too.

Eventually he did get up to lock the door.

L and I joked around that there was a ghost, and SIL, who’s never experienced anything paranormal, got kinda spooked but tried to play it off by jokingly saying she would use her rosary for protection. L explained to SIL that every house we’ve ever lived in was coincidently haunted and something always happened.

I rebutted with: “The houses or our family?”

Fast forward to my family deciding to go bowling that night and I stayed behind to take care of the puppies. My family left around 5 or 6pm and I decided to just chill in my room and use my computer.

I made sure all the puppies were inside, my cats were inside, and I made sure all the doors were locked even though the sun was still out.

I was pretty much comfortable in my room. Daisy and Kovu were sleeping on the floor, Lola and Chico were on my bed, the cats were in their tower, and the puppies were knocked out after running around in the backyard with their parents all day.

It was quiet, I was listening to music and then I noticed that the dogs were moving. It’s like one of those moments where you’re so focused on what you’re doing and then notice something isn’t right.

Kovu and Daisy were walking in and out of my room and Chico and Lola had their head raised, quite confused. I removed my headphones and just very slightly, I could hear soft knocking. I thought I was imagining it at first, normally when someone’s on our property the dogs go crazy and start barking, even the puppies were picking up their parents’ habits and would start barking too.

But they were quiet, still sleeping in the laundry room and the older dogs…they were hearing it, but they looked just as confused.

I instantly went to check, thinking it was our elderly neighbor who is living by herself, thinking she needed help. The knocking was coming from the front door and our neighbor always made sure to knock on the sliding door. It took me a minute to register that she wasn’t knocking, and I was already standing in our kitchen looking out the window looking at no one.

Here’s the kicker, both the front door and the back door have an exterior metal door and I heard someone knocking on the interior door, which is wood. I then remembered that I had locked both doors, so the knocking should have been on the exterior door.

My brain immediately went to coyotes, as we live in the lower desert in an agricultural city and my parents have chickens in the back. So, I let the dogs outside, thinking they would go running to the back to chase the coyote. They didn’t.

Then I remembered that it was knocking, not scratching, so I immediately thought someone was trying to break into the house since there was no cars in the driveway.

I waited for the dogs to start running to the backyard, but all they did was look to the direction of the sliding door, completely quiet and still confused. All four of them.

I looked to the back too and realized the lights were off and I couldn’t see anything. I still wasn’t sure what was going, but I was starting to get an inkling that it wasn’t a living person who knocked on the door. I went back inside to put on my sandals and get my phone, closing the exterior door behind me, thinking the dogs would start barking at any moment.

Once I had everything I needed, I went to check on the dogs again, they still hadn’t moved away from where they were and were still looking toward the sliding door. As soon as I was going to go into the laundry room to turn on the lights from the backyard, my parents were entering our driveway and *that’s* when the dogs started barking in excitement.

This happened on the first day of October, nothing else has happened after that. I told my brother what happened but waited a couple of days to tell SIL since I didn’t want to scare her more.

I was happy to get out of my home state Arizona and get into the lovely fall weather and mountain cool air that SLC is known for; as well as getting all the incentives the company was offering for out of state work.

My crew had about 4 days off the entire month of October, so we took every opportunity to explore the city and experience nature. I looked into all the local hiking trails and was able to find Doughnut Falls on a hiking list. The falls looked impressive in the photos online, it ran through a cave and fell into a creek that went down the mountain. Just the type of scenic nature I miss out on in Phoenix. 
     
That Saturday we were working another long shift. It was a beautiful cloudy day with fluffy, humid snow showers. We got out just after noon and I invited my two co-worker buddies to come along. I returned to my hotel, did a quick change into casual winter wear (canvas shoes, jeans, sweater, with layers)  and met my co-workers downstairs where we all piled into my car. My heater had just gone out that week, but I wasn't concerned about it as the fan still worked and we were dressed plenty warm for the mild evening chill. The snow was still quite light so we hadn't planned for any intense weather on the trip, plus working in -0°F weather over nights had accumulated us to the cold conditions.

We drove the short distance from South Jordan to Big Cottonwood Canyon and made our way up the winding road, taking in all the woodland ambience that surrounded us. The road eventually passed a small parking area that opened up to the Doughnut Falls trail head. We parked and prepared for our trek up the trail. The snow had started to pick up and was now making larger flakes, but we brushed it off because a little inclement weather wasn't about to stop our once in a lifetime opportunity to see some amazing wilderness.

The hike was pleasant. We had a snowball fight, shared a flask and told stories about skin walkers and our cultural folklore. The trail was mildly challenging. It followed a creek up the canyon crossed it several times, and even wove through trees and light brush. We passed what I believe was a small ranger cabin about halfway up the trail, and the forest began to become more dense around us as we progressed.
Just before dusk we reached the falls, where we had to maneuver over the creek and around a little pond that formed in the valley between boulders below the falls. Everything was covered in snow and water, which rewarded each of us with wet shoes and photos of the scenery. 

While I was balancing on a boulder trying not to slip into freezing water for a photo, two distinct figures poked up across the pond/creek that we had to shimmy our way around to reach the falls. They were quite a distance away from us, about 100+ feet, so I wasn't able to take in all the intricate details of their facial features, but I was able to discern a middle aged man and woman. She held onto the man's arm, while his other arm extended above and held a black umbrella over them both. What made them notable was the fact that they were wearing completely black outfits: black trench coats, black pants, black boots, black gloves, and black  hats. This was out of the ordinary from all the hikers we passed on the way up, all whom wore standard hiking attire (windbreakers, snow jackets, hiking boots, etc.). I pointed them out to my co-workers, and we continued to take photos for each other while the snow continued to weigh heavier and the clouds quickly began to lose their lumincense.

The couple stood atop the trail at the beginning of the pond, took in the view for a few minutes, then turned  and disappeared down the trail faster than they had appeared. Seeing that the couple didn't even take the time to get close to the falls, we realized that we had to head back down the trail if we wanted to make it back before we got snowed in or it became completely dark. We quickly made our way around the pond and creek back to where the couple was, trying to see if we could catch up closer to them so our groups would be a little closer (I assumed they were locals and knew the trail better). We caught up to where they were standing, but to our surprise there was no sign of anyone being in the area. Not a single print. A playful panic began to rise as we started to jog back down the creek, looking for signs of the couple or the trail. While we rushed down we came into a fork in the creek. We weren't sure which way led back to the trail head but I was able to convince my co-workers to trust my intuition and take the left fork despite their desire to take the other fork. We continued along the creek and found the ranger cabin, which indicated to us that we were in the clear. Soon enough we had reached my car, then after clearing the 2 inches of snow that had accumulated and some fancy ice driving in the dark we were back in SLC.

The image of that mysterious couple we encountered that year stuck with me. I have no idea who they were, what they were doing up there, where they came from, or where they went. We found no signs of anybody being on the trail on our way down. I looked at the trail on satellite images and found no alternative locations/trails they could have went to. In hindsight it was foolish to be on the trail that late in such conditions. I briefly looked into local legends but never found anything similar to the couple we saw. Utah has an interesting history with religion and colonization; it's Ted Bundy country after all. I have no doubt that SLC attracts dark paranormal entities, but since I have not found any resemblance in local legends I simply identify them as Death and his companion, Misery.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934415,public,new,self,Death and Misery in Salt Lake City,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rgn0g3/death_and_misery_in_salt_lake_city/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know I sound delusional and none of this may make sense but what my father and I seen last night is eating us alive and we are in search for answers that may be more logical than the situation itself. 

I’m 24f, dad is 55, he lives in a rural part of Nova Scotia, and I am down visiting.    

There’s this one street down by the ocean that has roughly 10 houses, they’re all my family (uncles, aunts, cousins etc) and my family has lived there for generations. The street itself is very rural (trees and fields between houses). It’s hard to explain but I want to try and show you a mental image of how the street is setup. 
My dads house is directly on the corner of the street where it begins, across from him is the ocean. If you were to head right out of his driveway, and walk for roughly 15 minutes you’ll reach a fork in the road, either you can go left to go down the path to get to the lighthouse (this is no longer a road you can drive, you have to walk) or you can continue on going straight for another 10 minutes and reach the beach. 

My dad and I took the left path as we always do on our late night walks, to go see the lighthouse and check out the waters. Keep in mind it’s 10pm and very dark out there because of how rural it is. 
Another quick price of information before I dive into what we saw: typically everyone knows everyone out there, and everyone is very mosey, as in they follow emergency vehicles, they all have police scanners etc. 

Okay so, dad and I are about half way down the path that leads to the lighthouse, keeping in mind on both sides of the path are trees, my dad actually hunts rabbits in this wooded area,that’s how big it is on either sides of the path.

As we continue to head down the path we were chatting about the stars and all of a sudden we hear weird footsteps/gravel moving behind us. It’s not uncommon to see or hear animals around here so we weren’t necessarily startled until we turned around. 

I swear on everything I believe in that what I’m about to describe, was a genuine thing that both my dad and I seen with our own eyes. 

Off the path by the trees was a 6ft+ man? Who was looking directly at us. My dad says “hey how’s it going” and it doesn’t reply. Dad shines flashlight in his direction. From the waist up he was wearing a blue almost military like shirt. He had a very dirty face with a weird looking beard. Dad does NOT know him. 

And then we seen it’s fucking legs. He was a man from the waist up, he had fucking hooves. Like a cenataur but he was on two legs and only had two legs. The way the legs were bent is what fucked my mind up the most, there was no way a human could put fake hooves in and have their legs buckle like that and them not over (Altho this is the only logical answer we can come up with, although we know it just doesn’t add up).

When my dad put his flashlight on the creatures “hooves” we just stood and stared in silence for two seconds before this creature fucking hops the bush and darts back into the trees. I can’t describe the clacking noise coming from the things feet. Obviously at this point my dad and I are not  Into the idea of continuing down to the lighthouse so we turn around to head back home, clearly both shaken up and confused. My dad is no stranger t the weird things that happen out here yet usually there is some type of explanation.

This is where it gets even more bizarre. If you haven’t started doubting my experience as made up yet, you will now.

As we turned around to head back down the path, we were only able to walk about  30 seconds before the forest around us erupted with noise. Ululating and a .. band? I can’t figure out what instruments we’re being played but my dad and I were frozen in disbelief before we hightailed it out of there. As we continued down the path it was like the noise followed behind us but as soon as we reached the end of the path and the beginning of the road it was almost like we hit a wall of white noise, just wind and crickets. 

We turn right to head back to the house and on our way back we see Uncle Bubby (my dads uncle) using his flashlight to look at something in his backyard, which is bordered by the same forest that surrounds the lighthouse path. 

As we walk closer we see what uncle bubby has his flashlight on and it’s a decapitated rabbit sitting beside a dead frog? We ask him if he heard anything in the woods (surely the whole street heard the explosion of ululating and impromptu band) he says no. We ask him what made him come outside to look in his backyard and he just says he was running something out to his garage and he heard leaves rustling so he went to look to see what it was. 

Dad made a police report just in case some weirdo is mutilating animals and scaring people in the forest but we both know what we saw wasnt human. I know how extreme all of this sounds but I am not fabricating anything I saw or felt. Please direct me to some information that may help explain what me and my dad and I just went through.

I am both a skeptic and a believer. I want to tell the stories that I have no reasonable explanation for. I apologize if I jump around a lot from experiences because I have quite a few I'd like to share and I want to keep them in one post as per the rules. 

I'll start with the most recent. I have a small black Christmas tree with battery powered purple lights on my art desk for the season. I've used it for a few years now and nothing strange ever occurred with it until recently. The first day I had it up the batteries died in the lights, and since I'm a chronic procrastinator, I have yet to replace them. The first night the tree's lights all turned on bright at exactly 2:45 am and remained on for a minute. Okay not a big deal, weird but perhaps the batteries still had a very small amount of juice. I tried to turn it back on and once again it wouldn't respond. I chalked it up as a fluke. Then it kept happening. The next three days it turned on at exactly 2:45 am and remained on for a minute before the lights all go out again. The fourth night my husband had a night shift the next day so he was up with me when it happened and he experienced it for the first time. He thought I replaced the batteries but I have yet to buy new batteries for it. There are none in the house. I told him about how it happens every night. He believed me but at the same time said it couldn't be at the exact time each night. Well the next night, lastnight, he was up with me again because he was off work the next day. The tree did it again at exactly the same time. Let me be clear the lights have a simple on off switch, no timer or anything. I can't explain it. 

My husband, formerly a huge skeptic, proposed something that really emotionally hurts me. He said maybe it was the time of death of my dad who passed away this year and lived in the apartment above ours. We didn't have an exact time of death from the coroner. I hadn't heard from him in 2 days, which was actually normal but when I called him and he didn't call back something was wrong. My husband went up to check and he had passed away. Due to those circumstances we don't have an exact time. This idea really upsets me. 

The next occurrence happened a few months before my dad passed away and a few weeks before losing my dog. I'm a night owl. I typically stay up working on art or reading a book all night and then go to bed at 6am. 

Anyway, I was up late at night drawing in the living room on the couch and my husband was sleeping in the bedroom. I had our dog with me, Misty. She was always with me. We heard foot steps coming behind the door rapidly like my husband was running to the door. I say we, because Misty reacted as well and ran over to the door with her fur standing up. I honestly thought my husband was in a hurry to get to the bathroom but then the door never opened. I went to check on him and he was asleep in the bed. Okay, so he must have been sleep walking I thought. I went back to drawing and eventually Misty and I heard it again. Still he didn't come through the door. It kept happening. So I waited without any of my art stuff piled on me so I could jump up and check real quick the next time. When it happened again I jumped up and immediately pulled the door open. My husband was asleep in the bed. There is no physical way he could have ran at the door and then been back in bed before I opened the door, especially without me hearing him. Our house is very long with the bedroom being the longest and taking several seconds to cross at a run. I opened the door when the footsteps got to the door exactly. I was half a foot step away from the door sitting on the end of our sectional. Misty was really freaked out by this as well.

I told my husband the next day and he said he was probably sleep walking or something like I originally thought. So he slept on the couch the next night and it happened over and over again that night but this time there was no one in that room to possibly cause it. My dad's apartment was above the bedroom but not the whole distance. His apartment starts at the half way mark to my bedroom. He couldn't have caused the footsteps unless he climbed through his window and walked on the roof. Which I even asked him about and he said no he hadn't and wouldn't do that. This happened every night for weeks until Misty was found to have a tumor in her stomach and I had to let her go. Then the footsteps just stopped. Haven't heard them since. But she was always with me when they happened, it definitely wasn't her causing them. They sounded like a grown man running across the length of the bedroom to the door. I have no idea what to make of that. Why would they suddenly stop the first night she wasn't with me? 

I have had many small things happen to me but I am trying to stick to the larger events that really impacted me. Before these two events the next one that comes to mind was almost 10 years prior. 

I was living with my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, and his father in a small trailer park in the middle of nowhere. There were maybe 10 trailer homes total with a dirt road coming off an old route. Behind our home was a small section of trees, only a few deep, and then a large cornfield. I was relieved to be away from my mom, step dad, and the creepy house I grew up in, which I'll get to in a little bit. I used to walk around the area alone at night and never had any fear or problems. 

I'll call my boyfriend/husband Pete from now on to avoid confusion. One night Pete and I were coming home from the mall and it was a really long drive. I don't see well at night, so I let him drive my blazer. His dad worked a night shift and was already at work for a few hours. When we pulled into our normal parking spot and shut the engine off I was hit with this awful dread. I have never felt dread this intense before or since and I hope I never do. I knew there was something or someone in the trees by the trailer and if we got out something awful was going to happen. I can't explain this fear and knowledge. I have had this happen before but never to this degree. I turned to tell Pete to not get out, to drive away instead, when he turned to me and asked if I could ""feel that?"" We drove away and didn't go back the rest of the night. We returned at day break when his dad was just getting home. I looked back in the trees but I never found anything. I seriously cannot explain in words the feeling I got and Pete confirmed he felt it too. It was like just knowing that we would die if we attempted to get to the house and whatever awful thing that would cause it was in the trees, just out of sight. I truly feel like we dodged our deaths that night. As I said I felt this before, just not as bad, but Pete was the first person to ever feel it with me as well. I kinda believe that may have been a person with very bad intentions but I will never know. 

Before that the one other instance that stood out to me with a similar feel happened when I was 16-17. I was on a trip with my dad, who was a truck driver at the time. I had already had something weird happen to me during the trip but I already posted about that in a different subreddit and I won't retell it here, as per the rules. Anyway, I was walking to the bathroom through the truck stop parking lot by myself. I go to the bathroom so often that my dad just said he trusted me to be fine going on my own, just inform him and go. So I did. I was walking through the few rows of trucks between us and the building when I all the sudden stopped cold. I knew something or someone was waiting for me around the next truck. Just an awful feeling that I should not go that way. I headed back to my dad and he walked me to the truck stop bathroom and we left that stop afterwards. 

Now I'll tell you about the experiences I had growing up. I had so many that I will try to keep them brief and only tell the most intense ones. 

Like most kids, I seen a lot of things when I was really young. My mom's side of the family was actually afraid of me. I don't remember it clearly enough but I've been told that I just had a way of knowing things I shouldn't and impossible things happened around me. 

When I was ten we moved into a new house that was built by my step dad's grandfather. To everyone's knowledge no one ever died in the house but it's menacing and active anyway. I have a brother who is 7 years younger than me. Immediately after moving in, he would wake up screaming and point to his toys. I remember it was every night. Then one night I understood because I seen his toys moving on their own when he was sleeping and I went to check on him. 

My mom and I used to hear a child's laughter coming from my brother's room. We always assumed it was him, until he started sleeping at his aunt's house on the weekends and we still heard it. 

I would see black shadows in a human shape constantly from the corner of my eye, which would disappear when you tried to look at them directly. My stereo would turn itself on and off constantly. The lights would do the same. The kitchen cabinets would open and bang shut. This was all ""normal"" in that house. My step-dad never believed us until he had an experience alone in the basement but he refused to ever tell us what happened. Even after his experience, my mom and step dad always just told me and my brother to ignore it because we were not going to be moving. When you live with that kind of daily thing and attitude you just start to shrug things off. There wasn't really much choice. 

I had a candle collection when I was about 14. One day I heard a bang and the shelf they were all on collapsed. The weird part was all the candles where standing up on the floor, like someone placed them there. 

I never had a friend stay the night more than once. They all were terrified by the middle of the night and would wake me up because they had experiences. One girl claimed she saw the shadow person. Another said something was touching her foot in the night. I never disclosed anything about the house because I didn't want them to panic and not want to stay again. 

When I was about 15 I became friends with a girl I will call L. She was a self proclaimed witch and I have to give her credit she didn't scare as easy. We were sitting alone in the living room talking when all the sudden we heard a knock the window behind my head on the window. Assuming it was my brother playing a prank, I pulled the curtain away really quick. He wasn't there and the knocking immediately moved to the window across the room behind L's head. The window behind me was on a balcony, totally possible someone could be on it. The one behind L was three stories off the ground and no possible way for someone to reach. There were no trees close to the house at all that could cause it. It was instantaneous that the knocking changed windows too. L actually decided to stay but by morning she said she would never stay over again either. She wouldn't say why. We are still friends today and she still doesn't talk about anything other than the knocking. Won't say what else bothered her. 

I will finish with one last thing. I grew up having nightmares of something chasing me. I know that's a typical dream theme but these always felt warped and wrong. I would dream it was a shape-shifting thing. It preferred the shape of a rat but would shift into anything to get close to me. It was always trying to bite me. It never managed it before I woke up but it was awful. There was always something wrong with whatever it was impersonating. Something was out of place, that's how I knew it was the same thing only a different form. Now it's very possible this was just a dream but it stopped when I moved out of my mom's house. I would feel dread when I woke up from dreams like that, not to the degree of the other instances I detailed here, but still  dread.

A little bit of background. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh but am currently living in Toronto. The experiences I’m about to share have happened in Dhaka. We live in an apartment in a pretty opulent part of the city. The apartment is approximately 3000 sq. ft. It has a long hallway that’s surrounded by the 3 bedrooms. My mom and dad live in the furthest room from the main door of the apartment and right across them lives my sister. My room is the closest to the main door across the living room.

So the hallway opens up into a balcony that has a complete glass wall with sliding doors on it. I’ll try to edit the post and add a picture of the apartment if that helps you visualize it better. We live on the fourth floor and at night it becomes almost dead silent. Since the neighborhood, we live in isn’t close to a busy street.

Now I want to state that I do believe in the paranormal but try to always debunk stuff logically. My parents usually go to bed around 11 pm and by 12 am they’re both asleep. The same goes for my sister. I usually stay up at night and watch shows unless I’m very tired. So the apartment is mostly tiled except for the bedrooms that have wooden flooring. More like wooden panels on top of the concrete so when you walk across it, there’s a very distinctive creak to it. The doors to the bedrooms also have mirrors on them and right across my door is my bed and on the other side, there’s a window. There aren’t many tall buildings around me so you can clearly see the moonlight through the windows or any streetlights that are outside. It doesn’t get pitch dark at night so even if all the lights are off, you can still pretty much see everything inside the room.

So the summer of 2018 I went back home during my break from university. Jet lag and the already present dismal sleeping pattern meant I pretty much stayed up all night. So one night I was lying down on bed fiddling around with my phone. I think it was somewhere around 2.30 or 3 am when I heard the sound of wind chimes outside. We have wind chimes on top of the curtain railings that are in front of the glass doors to the balcony (we keep the curtains closed at night). Living in that apartment for the better part of my life, I could tell exactly which wind chime it was just from the sound. Initially, I thought it was prolly my dad grabbing a smoke. But then I looked at the time and it’s a weird time for him to do that as he’s a pretty heavy sleeper and I didn’t hear their door open or close (the doors to the bedrooms are very heavy).

I tried to concentrate more and I could hear the faint noises of footsteps. Now I know exactly what the footsteps of my mom, dad, and sister sound like and I couldn’t recognize those steps. They weren’t heavy but neither were they dainty. I could clearly make out that it was coming towards my room and I instinctively looked at my door to see if the light was coming from under it. I hear the footsteps approach and stop right in front of my room. I wait for around 30 seconds and then I hear three sharp knocks on my door. I remember feeling a sense of dread since if it was anyone in my family, the knocks would be followed by my name and no one in my family knocks that politely.

I thought I was hallucinating and decided to concentrate more. I looked at the mirrors on the door and focus on the light being reflected from it. I didn’t reply to the knocks as something inside me told me to not answer. Sure as hell about another 30 seconds or a minute later, I hear three more knocks. Louder than before and I clearly saw the reflection of the light vibrate. This scared me a lot and I pulled the blanket over me and started praying. After a while, I heard footsteps receding from my room and the eventual chime of the wind chime. I couldn’t sleep at all and decided to stay up till the Fajr adhan (Muslim call to prayer from the mosque)

I told my parents about it and they didn’t believe me. My sister too told me she never experienced anything of the sort.

Ever since that incident, I've been visibly disturbed. I have never had a paranormal experience before save a few shadow people sightings which I just brush off as not concrete. I made it a habit to fall asleep early or if I couldn't sleep, I'd stay awake till the Fajr adhan. The next few nights nothing happened so I brushed off the entire incident as either a lucid dream or a hallucination.

After about 3 nights of nothingness, I was back to my regular business. Same as the first night, I heard the chimes, the footsteps, and the knocks. Only this time the knocks were louder, to the point that I clearly saw the whole door shake. That night I ended up staying awake till the adhan again.

If you're wondering what the significance of the adhan is, in our faith we believe in Jinns which is comparable to demons. It is said that Jinns are active at night and try to mess with people. Only after the Fajr adhan, do they leave you alone So that was my thinking.

The third incident is by far the worst for me. Same as the other two times, I heard the wind chimes, the footsteps, and the knocks. Just like the other two days I faced away from the door and pulled my blanket on top of me. But like the other days, it didn't stop at the knocks.

After the knocks, I heard the creak of my floor. It was so distinct that I was sure someone just stepped on the wooden panels. It takes about 3 steps from the door to the edge of my bed and I heard 3 exact creaks. Getting louder with every step. I was sweating under my blanket and reciting every prayer I could think of at the moment. I made it a point to not look behind me as I've heard you shouldn't look at a Jinn directly or else they'll attack you.

After the creaks, I felt the weight of my bed shift as if someone sat on the bed. We had those European-style beds with a huge mattress on top of it so it takes some weight to deform them. It doesn't just deform by itself. I had the AC on so the room was cold as is but since I had the blanket on top of me, it was pretty warm inside. As soon as the weight on my bed shifted, I felt a chill down my entire back as if someone just put a block of ice my size against my back.

I didn't hear anything. In fact, I didn't want to hear anything. I felt as if someone was breathing down my neck. This is what haunts me. I can explain away everything to a certain degree but not the breathing. Then as soon as it happened, it stopped. Everything went back to normal. I did not move from that position till the adhan and fell asleep that way.

Nothing of that sort happened to me after that. I've been back home almost every summer after that. Fast forward to August of 2021. I was back home and on a video call with my girlfriend. I left her on the phone and went to the bathroom (my bathroom isn't attached to my room. You have to go outside the door to go to the bathroom). I came back and saw that the light and AC in my room were turned off. As soon as I turned the light back on my girlfriend started calling me. I picked my phone up and she was hysterical. She asked if I came into my room or not and I said no. She told me she saw the light go off and heard someone walking around in my room (the floor creaks). That scared the shit out of me.

It wasn't a circuit breaker as the bathroom light is also on the same circuit as the electrical outlets in my room so my bathroom light would've gone out too. It also wasn't anyone in my family as I would've heard them come towards my room (my bathroom door is right beside my bedroom door).

As of now, these are the only things that have happened to me. As far as I know, none of my family members ever witnessed or experienced anything of that sort.

1) A friend and I were walking home next to a graveyard in a poorly lit area. In the corner of my eye I see a white figure without features in a kind of human shape. My friend then seems panicked and says please tell me you can see that over there, neither of us look directly at it but both sprinted away for a good 10 minutes, still gives us the creeps whenever we speak about it. 

2) my friend and I were driving down a country lane at night, and again in our peripheral vision we both see a white featureless figure standing there amongst the darkness. Both absolutely scared shitless he speeds up. 

Both occasions my friends and I were instantly scared by this thing, and felt the need to get away from it. Without coming to any logical conclusion as to what it could be.

I´ve lived alone for a bit over a year already, he also had been living alone for over a year. I think it is important to say that I have 2 dogs, they are both Xoloitzcuintles this dogs were thought to be companions to the spirits by the Aztecs.  


 I´ve never really experienced weird paranormal things, I used to live at a house were weird things happened like a tombstone appearing out of nowhere and weird noises. At this point after living with my friend and my dogs at this house we can all agree there is something paranormal happening here. It all started even before I moved in, one night him and I were chatting and he had to go to the store to pick up some food so I stayed at his place alone. While I was on the phone with my partner I could hear steps upstairs, I started feeling uncomfortable and didn't want to hang up the call. At that point it was one of the first times I felt afraid of something like a ""ghost"", I could definitely hear it walking around upstairs.   


When my friend got home he said it was probably someone at the house next door walking, now that I live here I can confirm that is not how that sounds, those were steps upstairs. When I moved in things started escalating, first one light would start flashing when we were both there, or even more when I was with other friends (we have noticed increased activity when there is more women here). We want to find a logical explanation, we obviously checked the bulb and even the cables, but things don't just break down and then magically fix themselves.   


We have cameras all over the house, one on the Ring device for the  doorbell, one inside for the living room/kitchen area, one for the front yard, and one for the backyard, they all are motion activated. The next thing that started happening and continues to happen is the doorbell ringing. When the doorbell rings we get a notification on our phones because there is obviously motion in front of it. The first time the doorbell rang without anyone pressing it I remember yelling at my roommate ""who is it?"" and he quickly asked me if a I got a notification. We then both looked at each other confused. While we were walking downstairs the doorbell rang again, before opening the front door to look outside I tried checking the doorbell camera on my phone, it showed a black screen. The doorbell rang a third time and that was it, whenever that happens it usually is either around noon or 9pm, it always rings in sets of 3.   


Now all of that didn't really scare me, even when I was alone at the house with a friend and I asked her "" is there an earthquake happening right now"" (quite a common thing here) and she said no. Someone had pulled my chair, that has happened 3 times already. I find those behaviors even child like, in Mexico we call them espiritus chocarreros. One night when my partner, roommate and I were kinda scared after the doorbell rang the moment we got into the house and we decided to play with a Ouija board I got on amazon for Halloween. Me and my roommate had tried playing it before, nothing really happened so we asked my partner to try talking to *it* he touched it and asked ""is there someone here"" I swear we all heard steps upstairs the moment he asked. Right after that the doorbell rang 3 times really fast, that really scared us, by the second ring I opened the app to see if there was something there so the camera started recording, I have the video, there is nothing there you can only hear our screams. The doorbell was ringing, the lamp right on top of us was swinging and there was noises upstairs, that was the worse night. 

So at his point lights flicker, the doorbell rings on sets of 3, we want to communicate with it, and today it graduated to turning on the water hose. Now that last part I thought it was interesting, I wanted to turn it on to fill a bucket but my shoes were upstairs so I ended up not going outside to turn the hose on. A couple of minutes after that my roommate goes outside and quickly comes inside to ask me if I turned the hose on cus there was water everywhere... I never went outside, he didn't either, the cameras didn't catch any movement so there was no one there.  


The dogs feel things, they even bark before they happen, at this point I'm just curious, I want to understand what it is. How can we communicate with it? I feel like it is sometimes here, not all the time. We want to start recording everything, but at this point I cant find an explanation for these weird little things happening.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934328,public,new,self,We are pretty sure something lives with us,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rgfbhk/we_are_pretty_sure_something_lives_with_us/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was around 8 years old back in the early 2000s I had a tamagotchi (as I imagine many kids did back then). One morning I wake up as I need to look after the tamagotchi, it's already sunny - as my curtains weren't blackout daylight was coming into my room. My bed was positioned so that my head faced the bedroom door when lying down. My door was open (as we didn't really shut our doors as a family), and I saw a figure stood there - but it had no defining features, it was like a cloud of darkness. I didn't feel scared, and I don't know why but I thought it was my older sister - I suppose it had long hair? I said my sister's name and sat up, and as I did it vanished. It never said anything to me but it was definitely looking at me.

Outside my bedroom door there was a mirror, which had a handprint on it that was definitely not mine. I don't know what it was, or who it was, but it definitely wasn't a dream as I was definitely awake. I've not really experienced anything like this since I was a kid but I do sleepwalk and sleep talk a lot, and experienced sleep paralysis over the past year which was terrifying, but this was different.

I remember exactly how they started small like me being playful and levitating myself around the apartment complex that I used to live in as a kid and flying all over the place and those were very fun. Then I had another dream one time where I was being chased by a monster plowing and running after me through the city. I was jumping into the air and levitating myself and I levitated myself high enough to get me out of what seemed danger. Recently in the last year I had them again. Mind you I'm explaining what I've experienced in my dreams over the course of several dreams but I'm pointing out which ones I think are the coolest. Again, over the course of the last year I had 3 really awesome ones and one of them was also terrifying. So in one I found myself in a kitchen of some sort. Like a hotel kitchen or butcher shop I can't decide but it was dark there were no lights on and my pov was lit by some flashlight pov like in your modern horror games where the only light you have on your screen is where your flash light points. I felt an immense amount of dark energy like a monster or demon out of nowhere and it was behind the double doors that led into the kitchen but these double doors didn't lock they swung open if you exit or entered. I don't know how but I realized that I could use my telekinetic power to get myself out of danger once again so I immediately gathered all the fridges, counter tops, chairs, and basically everything that isn't bolted to the wall or floor and threw them at the door congesting/blocking the door way making whatever was behind those doors looking to come in, impossible to do so. Immediately I felt the anger and rage this brought upon whatever was behind those doors and they pushed back but mind you I was holding the stuff at the door with all my might and force and we had a battle but they never got in. Another dream was when I took a nap once and found myself in a beautiful grassy area with trees and a house. There was 3 witches and I immediately went inside the house and one called ""hey WAIT!"" I created an invisible ball of telekinetic energy knowing I can get myself out of any scary situation and through the invisible energy ball into a witches face pissing her off and immediately I levitated myself and the entire house off the ground and took it on a flight across the fields to get away and then levitated the house and I up into they sky where I moved us through the clouds and rapid rate holding everything in place and the house not falling apart at all. Lastly in my final dream I was on a beautiful beach shore somewhere in the universe. It wasn't planet earth because I was able to see other planets in the distance and the sky was orangey sunset like and very beautiful. But of nowhere an apocalyptic cosmic storm of meteors and clouds of lighting began to approach threatening the life on this planet and volcanoes in the distance Yellowstone like began to become irritated and shoot magma and clouds of ash and me knowing what I can do decided to put my all into preventing this apocalyptic cloud in the atmosphere from approaching the planet and destroying it so I ""gathered"" it yelling with all my might and power and basically created a colossal force field of telekinetic energy and at the same time deflecting the catastrophic cloud back into space and away from the planet and i could feel that it took everything in my soul to do this. Once I sent the cosmic storm back into space and in another direction saving this planet I passed out on the ocean shore and I remember someone finding me there, picking me up and carrying me away .... idk if this is paranormal but these recurring dreams have allowed me to play with abilities in my dreams and control what I want to do in some dreams also",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934263,public,new,self,Recurring Dreams Of Powerful Telekinesis,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rg8hz5/recurring_dreams_of_powerful_telekinesis/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some reason when i walk into the room, i get a bad feeling that there's something else in there. In the dream i find a small porcelain doll of an angel or something and take it. I keep it with me for the day until it looks like it's around 7 pm or something. Weird stuff happened during that day, but the dreams kinda blurry so i don't remember exactly what they are. My ""sister"" doesn't seem bothered at all this whole time. I get a feeling that whatever's in the room is connected to the doll, and i try to get rid of it. I'm in the bathroom where i found it (it's connected to the room) and look in the mirror but see something behind me. I turn around quickly and fall to the floor. Last thing that happens is this big black shadow thing lunges at me then i wake up. As i said, this dream keeps happening and starts and ends at the same places.

I have no idea how old it was as I was young.

I wasn't really freaked until I went to bed that night. Everything was fine, I felt kinda creeped but nothing unusual for an 11-12 year old in a new house.

I woke up in the middle of the night, no idea what time it was. I remember it so vividly, literally everything, even the way I was laying on the bed. I woke up with my head tilted directly staring into the upper corner of the room and I saw a young boy just... sitting up there in the corner. He was wearing modern clothes though, nothing weird about his appearance, but of course I was startled as hell and jumped. After I startled he disappeared. I rolled over in bed, my door was open. The hall light was on, and I saw a man's shadow move across the floor. I don't remember much after that.

Now, I know that seems like it could be a nightmare. Scared the hell out of me, but whatever. I begged to not have to sleep in that room but nobody believed me, obviously. From that point on as I was falling asleep I'd hear a voice in my ear, not a whisper or anything but more like a distant shout or just a word. I don't remember any of what it was though. One night I was falling asleep and as I was about to close my eyes I saw a black skirt beside me, as if someone was sitting very close to my head. Jumped up and it was gone.

Once, while I was in that room, my stepbrother came in, and when he left he started crying. I didn't really care much because I figured he tripped or stepped on something, but my stepdad came in and shouted at me for throwing a plastic toy at him. I insisted that I didn't, because I *didn't*. 

Another thing about this room is there was always like... a weird shadow coming from it. It could've been the architecture of the house but I swear it was foreboding.

I have one more clear memory of weird shit going down in that bedroom, from my account at least. I am not a religious person - not anymore, at least. But at the time I was, so I thought maybe bringing a bible into the room would help. And as I sat reading it, I swear to fuck there was breathing in the wall behind me, raspy breathing. I ran out of there and outrivht refused to be in there anymore and started sleeping on the couch or at relatives houses.

One night when I was gone, my mom and stepdad got into a fight and he ended up sleeping in my room. He stopped getting mad that I wouldn't sleep in there and I got to move to a different room. One night we were alone together and I asked why I got to move rooms. I want to say that this was a horrible man, an abuser, someone who was awful to me. And he started crying. He said that when he slept in there, he saw a shadow across the wall of the room, holding a rifle or shotgun or something like that, and a man's voice. He wasn't sure if the man was talking to him or not, but he said the voice was talking about ""having to protect the children.""

He wouldn't tell me anything else but he was straight up crying and I was stunned. No one went in that room anymore. My mom started to get freaked by the room when my infant sister's blanket ended up in the closet in the room somehow.

I guess I wanted to post this to see what people thought, because although what I mostly experienced were two children, there was also a man. And I felt terror in that room. Demons? Spirits? I don't know, I'm not very well versed in paranormal terminology.

The reason im so concerned is because my brother also saw it. Basically my first experience w this thing was when i was on facetime with my friend sitting on my couch. the way i was sitting was facing away from my fireplace. my face wasnt in view on my camera, i was just talking and my phone was resting on my lap. i glanced at my phone and i saw an arm above me? my friend saw it too. My arms were underneath my blanket so i know it wasnt me. i just quickly went upstairs and tried to not look back. i was spooked but i tried to just get past it thinking my camera glitched or something. fast forward a week and me and my brother are sitting on the same couch just talking. The energy gets really cold and uneasy suddenly and he thinks he sees something moving behind me. I bring up what happened a while ago. He’s not the type to get easily scared but he swears that something is there. We turn off the lights and leave the couch and while we are standing near the exit of the room he makes eye contact with what he describes as a “deer with a flat head”. It had no antlers and he says it didnt seem upset, just curious. On the way up the stairs he says he saw a hand wrapping around thr corner of the wall too. He tried showing me but i didnt see anything. I felt it the uneasy energy though. Another thing is at night i see a shadowy almost human like figure down my stairs. Again since im such a paranoid person i just ignore it, but after sharing that information with him he says he sees it too. Something we both found funny but a little unsettling is that our cat at night always just stares down our stairwell for hours. Like not even sleeping mf just watches nothing.

So my buddy found out about a old burnt down house in the country.

The backstory behind this haunting is that a women lived that apparently was into occult activities. She had brought some local children to the house and they were never seen again. This angered the locals and they burnt her house down with her in it. I can’t verify the accuracy of that story it’s just what I was told. 

Anyway we go there in the middle of the night with our cellphones trying to catch EVPs or something. We’re there for awhile and we catch something that sounded like a voice but otherworldly. I can’t remember exactly what was said. Anyway we decide to leave. So we’re rushing to the vehicle after hearing the recording. The person trailing behind all of us claims she felt a breath on her neck so she rushed faster. We go home no problem. 

I live in this house at the time that always creeps me out. I would see shadow people periodically walking through my room at night. My dog hated the room he wouldn’t even go in there. The dog used to do random things like stare at the ceiling or into the closet and growl or bark aggressively. Anyways I say all that to outline the fact that I’ve already had multiple paranormal experiences before this one that spooked me the most. 

So post ghost hunt I go home. I’m already creeped out by the house and my room so I set my tv to sleep every night a few hours after I fall asleep. I set the tv up like normal and pass out. A hour or so later I wake up and look at the TV and it’s on white noise. It shouldn’t have been like that because my mom had satellite tv with premium channels. I had left it on a premium channel so I was tripping out on it being on the white noise and grainy. Then I start hearing muffled moaning. Think covering someone’s face with a pillow and them struggling to yell or something. So I look into the mirror directly across from my bed and I see what looks like a pale women with long greasy black hair and a dirty dress crawling down my wall directly towards me. At this point I spaz out and my tv turns off. So it’s dark and frantically hit the light switch. To see nothing. 

The weirder part is the next morning I woke to take a shower and as I’m walking towards the shower I look in the mirror and notice scratches down the middle of the back.

So now my question is, is she the child that educator is going to have? She looks a lot like the two-year-old following me around so I guess so. I also calculated that the educator might be pregnant since August and I have been seeing her around. 

I also notice that she is only present at boarding school when that educator is working. At this point I just don' know what to do.

Maybe someone can tell me if they've had a similar experience?

As a toddler, my favorite VHS tape was The Muppets Sing Alongs (1995) video and my mom would usually put it on while rocking me to sleep in her rocking chair, humming along, while I dozed off in her arms. After falling asleep this one particular night, I was suddenly awakened by a very bright light and instead of finding myself in my mother's arms, I could sense that I was laying alone on the sofa. My neck hurt, and it felt as if my body was paralyzed, and as I began to focus, I realized that the bright light was coming from the television set. I remember trying very hard to focus on moving my sight away from the bright light, but whenever I tried to break free from the paralysis, the television volume just kept getting obnoxiously louder and louder and louder with every effort I would make. It felt as if the television set was reacting at my efforts to break free from its spell by intimidating me, and it didn't want me to look away. I could clearly hear Kermit, Miss Piggy, and the other Muppets singing a familiar tune behind the bright light, but all I could see was a giant, dense, spinning, pulsating aura. Then, almost magically, the aura seemed to ""pop"" and I regained the ability to sit up. All around me, I saw nothing but static darkness and silence.

My memory somewhat fades from there, but I know I started to cry very loud, so I imagine my parents probably let me sleep in their room or put me in my crib. This was at an old wooden house my parents used to rent downtown in the early 90's in South Texas. I don't have many memories from that time period but every once in a while, I pass by the house. It looks like it will be destroyed and rebuilt soon judging from the boarded-up door and windows.

I was actually still sleeping on my chair in the dream. But it was inside a bus and the person sitting next to me woke me up to talk with me. We were talking about normal stuff for a short while.

The dream reverted back to my car by now. I'm seated to driver seat, that person on passenger seat from where the photo taken. 

Now i asked him what is he doing in my car? He asked me back ""I'm asking you the same, what are you doing in my place?!"" This time i woke up to reality.

I didn't say a single word. wide awake now, just drove back to home town without a single stop. My fastest 1hr drive ever in that road.

When we were kids I had my own room. My two little sisters had to share theirs, and one night we thought it would be fun to trade rooms. I was around 11, they were 8 and 7. We'll call them Kate (8) and Alice (7).

We set up our blankets and pillows in each other's beds, Kate slept on the floor next to Alice on my bed. I fell asleep alone in their room and all was well. But the next morning something seemed wrong. My sisters looked terrified and said they never wanted to trade rooms again. I asked them why not?

Apparently they had stayed up very late, chatting and giggling with each other (probably joking about farts, if I know them) when Kate had suddenly gone silent. Alice turned over in the bed and saw what she described as ""a very tiny man with a head like a sideways football."" She said it was standing in the doorway looking back at them. It just stared for a few moments and they were too scared to respond.

Finally, it took some steps towards them and Kate freaked out. ""She threw her pillow at it"" Alice said, ""And it ran away.""

It's hard to get more details from them, because as we grew older Kate became estranged from the family and Alice remembers it, but is still too afraid to talk about it. It still makes me shake because they both saw it and their reactions were not at all typical of their behavior. And I have to wonder...why was it coming into my room?

The house we are now renting is very nice but obviously not home so it’s definitely been quite an adjustment for my parents and I but still have been in very high spirits when we think about moving into our new home (soon) and starting our new lives in AZ, but soon that changed when all three of us started experiencing something strange and very unexplainable. After living in the rental for about a month, I had my first experience. I was laying in bed late at night when i thought I felt vibrations on my floor then pressure on my bed that made its way to the head of my head. It felt like someone came running into my room then jumped onto my bed then started running up to where my head was laying. I quickly jumped up to look around and saw nothing, so I just thought I was half asleep and lightly dreamed it all. The next night it happened again and this time I know I wasn’t asleep and I know I didn’t imagine it! It felt so real and scared the shit out of me. It got to the point where I was too scared to fall asleep. This went on for about two weeks when I finally decided to tell my parents about what I was experiencing, and when I told them they were shocked. It turns out they were also experiencing some frightening things and honestly, they were worse then mine.  A lil back story for my mom’s scary experience.. (about 10 months ago my dad got shoulder surgery so during his recovery he was switching between his recliner and his bed durning the night depending on what he felt would make him the most comfortable) so one night my parents were both in their room sleeping when my mom woke up to my dad crawling in bed next to her. Thinking he was moving from the recliner to the bed to be more comfortable, she switched her position to facing him and when she opened her eyes my Dad was not laying in bed next to her. Instead he was sound asleep in his recliner. My mom freaked out, she was certain she felt him crawl in bed with her. This continued to happen to her for MULTIPLE weeks. The last story is my Dad’s, and I could easily say that his sounds the most terrifying. One night my dad was laying on his recliner in my parents bedroom when he would feel his ankle being pulled. The sudden movement woke him up and he saw a dark shadowy figure right in front of him, standing by his feet. His instinct was to push himself back into his chair as an attempt to back away from whatever was in front of him but before he knew it the figure was gone.

As a toddler, my favorite VHS tape was The Muppets Sing Alongs (1995) video and my mom would usually put it on while rocking me to sleep in her rocking chair, humming along, while I dozed off in her arms. After falling asleep this one particular night, I was suddenly awakened by a very bright white light and instead of finding myself in my mother's arms, I could sense that I was laying alone on the sofa. My neck hurt, and it felt as if my body was paralyzed, and as I began to focus, I realized that the bright light was coming from the television set. I remember trying very hard to focus on moving my sight away from the bright light, but whenever I tried to break free from the paralysis, the television volume just kept getting obnoxiously louder and louder and louder with every effort I would make. It felt as if the television set was reacting at my efforts to break free from its spell by intimidating me, and it didn't want me to look away. I could clearly hear Kermit, Miss Piggy, and the other Muppets singing a familiar tune behind the bright light, but all I could see was a giant, dense, spinning, pulsating aura. Then, almost magically, the aura seemed to ""pop"" and I regained the ability to sit up. All around me, I saw nothing but static darkness and silence.

My memory somewhat fades from there, but I know I started to cry very loud, so I imagine my parents probably let me sleep in their room or put me in my crib. This was at an old wooden house my parents used to rent downtown in the early 90's in South Texas. I don't have many memories from that time period but every once in a while, I pass by the house. It looks like it will be destroyed and rebuilt soon judging from the boarded-up door and windows. As in regard to sleep paralysis, that is one of the few times it didn't involve seeing a dark humanoid figure or having the sensation of a something sitting on my chest, or pinning me down.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934128,public,new,self,Super Loud Television,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rfzjgg/super_loud_television/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The little boy appeared to be around my age, but he was black and white and dressed in an old-fashioned way. I remember he had short hair. I’m not sure if I was in a half-dream kind of state. My parents would wake up in the middle of the night and see me having a conversation by myself under my bed. They’d tell me to “go back to bed” while guiding me back to bed. They thought I was still dreaming while they did this (they thought that it was best to not wake-up a sleep-walking/talking child). They also thought that it was best not to talk about the sleep-walking/talking because they thought that drawing attention to it might cause it to occur more often. Anyway, the conversations occurred on a regular basis. Years and years later I asked my parents about it. They told me they thought I was just sleep-talking/walking. 

I’d also have recurring nightmares where I’d have to save my parents/grandparents from an evil entity that was connected to the little boy somehow. 

One distinct recurring nightmare went as follows: my parents, paternal grandparents, and I were living in a creepy looking mansion. Everything was in shades of grey, including us. There were peculiar things that would happen around the mansion: objects appearing in places where they hadn’t been left, etc.. An evil entity would kill my maternal grandpa first and then my paternal grandma. The deaths were not graphic. It was more like a single tap from the entity would suck the life from someone. If I remember correctly, my grandpa was killed first in his sleep. I remember seeing a black/smoky shadow reach him in his bed. My grandma later caught on to the activities of the evil in the mansion and went to warn everyone. She was successful in warning my mom, but unfortunately, the evil entity manifested itself as the little boy and bit her hand. Once bit, she passed away. My mom grabbed my dad and I and we rushed out of that mansion as quickly as possible. That’s how the dream ended. I kept telling my dad about this dream because it bothered me a lot.

The next recurring dream (this dream only occurred at my maternal grandma’s house) went as follows: The setting was my grandma’s house. My grandma was involved in some paranormal stuff somehow (not at all like her in real life). The little boy captured my parents who were dressed in their wedding attire for some reason. I had to go on a quest in order to save my parents (my grandma guided me somehow). There was a time limit. I’d always just about reach my parents as the time was nearing its end when I’d wake up before seeing the conclusion. 

One recurring dream really bothered me in a profound way. I’d be out and about on a green field or something talking with friends. While doing so, I could see beings from another dimension looking down on the kids hanging out on the field. The beings made some sort of bet involving me. Some sort of action was performed (like flipping a coin or rolling a dice, but more profound - involving large gears and stuff). One of the beings won the bet while the other lost. As a result, I ended up not having being born at all. I was seemingly teleported to the gears/machinery and some kind of process was taking place. I tried to stop it, but there was nothing I could do. Everyone back on the field didn’t notice I was gone because I had never existed. The little boy was connected in the dream somehow. I never told anyone about this dream because it was the most unsettling.

As a young kid, I had always felt uneasy in that room. I had an intense feeling that if I stayed on top of my bed, I’d be safe during the night. I have memories of some force connected to the little boy trying to drag me and my blankets off the bed. I’d clutch the blankets and  hold onto my bed post for dear life. It was probably a dream, but it felt very real.

One day, my dad told me that if I had a bad dream with the little boy to imagine that the little boy was wearing a dress. During a nightmare I did just that. I laughed and laughed and laughed. I stopped having the first and second recurring dreams.

When I switched rooms to the basement (when I was older), I still felt an uneasiness, but it’s almost like it took a different form. I still felt that I was safe as long as I stayed on top of my bed throughout the night. One time I experienced sleep paralysis which was scary.

I remember that the uneasiness and recurring nightmares faded completely when I moved to a different house.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934112,public,new,self,Conversations Under My Bed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rfyn6l/conversations_under_my_bed/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the most beautiful yet chilling paranormal experience I’ve had in awhile, so hear me out. I’ve had several paranormal experiences and have posted about them before, but they’re your typical spirit encounters. This was… different. And it definitely was NOT a normal dream, by far.

This occurred last week:

I woke up in a beautiful hotel. I travel for work so I’m used to staying in hotels, and I had a job in Oklahoma coming up so I assumed I was at a hotel on my Oklahoma job (although it was such a beautiful hotel, I was surprised my boss let my partner and I stay there as it looked expensive). My main concern was the amnesia I was clearly having. I couldn’t remember getting to the hotel, and I had no idea if I was late to my job, or if my partner was worried and looking for me. 

I wondered about the possibility if I was dreaming or not, as it definitely did NOT feel like a dream but it’s not normal for me to have amnesia or be so confused in real life. So I decided to “test it” by running my hands under the hot water of the faucet. See, in my dreams, I’m never able to feel physical sensations (like touch, heat, pain, etc) so this is a test I’ve used multiple times to tell if I’m dreaming or not, and it has never failed me. I could feel the water, but it also got so hot that it actually burned me and I could feel it, which convinced me I must be awake. At that point, I knew if I wasn’t dreaming then I must be having a serious mental breakdown.

I decided to leave my hotel room and seek help, with the hopes that someone would take me to the hospital where someone could alert my family to come get me. I saw a golden elevator down the hall from my hotel room and decided to take that to the lobby to request help. There was a hotel worker (I think they’re called bellhops) standing inside the elevator. He nodded at me so I knew he could see me, but when I tried to ask for help it’s like he couldn’t hear me, as if I wasn’t meant to be there as a guest. The elevator eventually went down to the lobby and that’s when things became *really* strange. 

There were people everywhere! Some of them could hear me, but not see me.  Some of them could see me, but not hear me. And still, there were others who couldn’t hear me OR see me. There were also other hotel employees stationed at different areas, like their job was to serve and assist the guests of the hotel. I kept yelling for help and while most of the employees ignored me (or couldn’t hear me) at least one told me “calm down, you’re confused because you’re not supposed to be here. It happens sometimes. You’ll be able to leave soon.”

As I wandered, I came to the edge of the lobby and noticed a giant herd of people entering the lobby from a wide hallway with open double doors. Most of the people were elderly, and most of them were wearing hospital gowns as they were being led on what looked to be a tour of the hotel by yet another one of the hotel employees. That’s when I got REALLY freaked out, as it seemed like all those people had just passed away and arrived at the hotel.

I started running the opposite direction when I passed another set of double doors to what looked like (from what I could see through the door’s glass pane windows) a bright white hallway, and the sign above the doors said “Afterlife.” Outside the doors, there was a line of people, single file, lined up against the wall, waiting for the doors to open. Almost like no one was being let into the afterlife yet? I’m not really sure.

I spent over three HOURS running around the hotel lobby alone, panicked. And it’s like I felt EVERY minute of every hour. It didn’t rush or go by quickly the way most dreams do. And trust me, I tried to wake myself up *over and over again* during those hours, just in case I really was dreaming, and I couldn’t… thus making me realize how SEVERE my hallucinations and delusions must be.

Finally, after yelling some more for help, I could hear someone else speaking English and yelling from the crowd of the lobby, responding to my calls! It was the voice of a young man with a strange twangy accent, and we both called out to each other, saying “I’m over here! I need help” / “I’m walking toward you! I need help too! I don’t know what’s going on!” / “I don’t know what’s going on either! Keep following my voice!” / etc. 

Eventually, we kept following each other’s voices until we PHYSICALLY bumped into each other and realized that although we could hear each other, we couldn’t see each other. So after bumping into each other, we both desperately searched for each other’s hands and then grabbed them tightly, afraid to let go and possibly lose the only other person we could communicate with.

The first thing I noticed when we grabbed each other’s hands was how intensely I could feel his hands in mine. The way our hands were clasped— picture his hands (palms down) and my hands (palms up), and grabbing each other’s hands like that. The 4 fingertips of each of my hands were pressed upon his palms, while my thumbs were pressed up against the back of his hands. I remember brushing my thumbs across his knuckles and feeling how rough they were, and I remember my fingertips not only feeling the creases of his palms, but even feeling the palm prints (like finger prints but on the palm) of his hands because they were so dry. 

Like I said, in my dreams I absolutely cannot feel the sensation of physical touch, and if I’m dreaming and realize I don’t feel physical touch when I should, it either instantly wakes me up OR it instantly turns into a lucid dream. I had to be awake, there was no other explanation.

After a few panicked comments back and forth to each other, it was clear that we were both experiencing the same thing— confusion, not knowing what was going on, already having been stuck in this strange hotel for hours, thinking we were having a breakdown (well, *I* thought I was having a breakdown, meanwhile he kept asking me “Am I dreaming?! Is this a dream?!” And I kept saying “No, I don’t think so, that can’t be right…” which freaked him out even more).

Since I knew at this point I couldn’t be dreaming, and based on the other things I had seen, I wondered if maybe we were dead. To test this theory, I asked “What year do you think it is?!” and he was thrown off and said “What?” And I repeated “Just tell me, what year is it?!” and he answered “It’s 19… uh… 1933!”

 I replied “No, no it’s not, it’s 2021! Quick! What’s your name?!” And he immediately responded, “Wayne! It’s Randy (or Andy?) Wayne!” 

Now, another thing to note: Another way to test if I’m dreaming is to ask someone a question… For example if I ask someone in a dream what their name is, I can “feel” my brain coming up with an answer before the other person can respond. So if this were a dream, I would *know* his name is (R?)Andy Wayne before he even has a chance to answer. That didn’t happen. He replied so quickly I was shocked, and it definitely isn’t a name I would have come up with in a dream, nor do I know anyone IRL named Randy, Andy, OR Wayne. 

When we first bumped into each other, I obviously couldn’t see him but I could see the thick crowd of people behind him in the hotel lobby, blocking my view. But then there was a break in the crowd behind him and I could see a window maybe 20-50 yards away (sorry, I’m not good at calculating distance), and I could see movement outside. So with one hand still holding onto one of (R)Andy’s, I said “Look! What is that?!” and started running to the window. When we got there and looked out, I saw a bunch of different homes and apartments, all connected to each other, in a bunch of different styles that made it appear very wacky, and we could sit there and watch as the “mountain” of homes continued growing and growing, and I couldn’t even see the top of it because it was growing up into the sky, even way above the clouds. We were both in shock, and the last thing I remember (R)Andy saying is “What in the… where are we?” Then he started praying out loud to himself.

Soon after, I managed to wake up in my bed. But I swear to you I felt just as awake in that “dream” as I do right now. 

And never have I had a dream where it lasted for hours, or where I was trapped and literally could NOT wake up. 

So many aspects of this “dream” are a first for me.

*Here’s some “extra” details of the dream— I was afraid if I went in chronological order with EVERY detail, it would take 25 paragraphs before anyone could even get to the “good parts.”*

• *The same night this dream occurred, before the dream started, I experienced astral projection for the first time. It actually happened 4 times in a row, as I kept trying to roll out of bed to use the bathroom but kept accidentally rolling out of my body instead. After I finally was able to use the bathroom, I went back to sleep, then the dream happened.*

• *When I decided to leave my bedroom to get help, I peeked outside my door and noticed that to my left, the hotel hallway *seemed to go on forever and ever,* with hundreds of doors just like mine. On the right, after a few other doors, is where the elevator was.*

• *As I walked toward the elevator, I passed a hotel room door that was wide open, and I looked inside and I saw a teenage girl brushing her hair in the mirror. She was dressed as if she was from a different time period, and even the inside of her hotel room was designed differently than mine— it was lacy with feminine flower wallpaper, wood floors with a beautiful antique carpet, and weird looking oil lamps instead of electric lights. I shouted out to her to see if she could help me, but it’s like she didn’t hear me nor see me.* 

• *In the lobby, I noticed there was a cafeteria, and I could see all different types of people in different eras of clothing dining together. It seemed like the lobby of the hotel had a bunch of other areas dedicated to certain things— restaurants, libraries, gardens, etc. As if the guests are meant to stay there long-term.*

TL;DR: I “dreamt” I was stuck in a type of limbo or “waiting area” for the afterlife, in the form of a hotel. I was stuck there for hours, and it felt just like real life which is rare for me. I saw a group of new arrivals being guided around the hotel, hundreds of them, and most of them were either elderly and/or in hospital gowns as if they had just passed away. Some people could hear me but not see me, some could see me and not hear me, or both. I even ran into another person as panicked as I was, we couldn’t see each other but we could hear and feel each other, and when I asked him what year it was and what his name was, he told me it was 1933 and his name was Randy (or Andy) Wayne. It truly seemed as if I was in another realm and we weren’t supposed to be there.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,934109,public,new,self,(Paranormal Dream) Trapped in “afterlife hotel” for hours; met a man from 1933 trapped there too.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rfyh5i/paranormal_dream_trapped_in_afterlife_hotel_for/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saying shirley (that’s the woman’s name) needs to see david (her husband) before she ‘passes’ so she can have peace her daughter saw her dad. I explained to her it was not me, I am not David. She mentioned he lives in (city name where I live) and his full name. So I looked him up.


He died. And she took a picture of his gravestone. And when I clicked her name, she died too. They’re gravestones are together. I started providing screenshots but she said it wasnt her. They’re the only people with that name that were a couple.  She and her husband are the only ones with that name. Then she ended the convo saying my moms name, that I do know him and to take care and bless.

I have lived here for two years now. During the time I’ve lived here some CREEPY SH** has happened that I can’t explain or rationalize. I want to share the three most recent since they’re fresh on my mind. 

Let me start by saying I am not scared of the paranormal, nor is my fiancé; she grew up in a haunted house and I did as well. I do think some aspects of it are scary I.e. demons, poltergeists, skinwalkers, etc. ; overall though I find it very interesting and spend hours researching it.  


1. This one actually happened to my fiancé. She was home laying downstairs on the couch with our youngest who was asleep on her chest and she was watching grays anatomy. She swears up and down she heard our oldest son (4) up in his room call her name and then giggle. Only problem is he is at my exes. It’s her day with him. Not ours. She said she felt her stomach drop, she walked upstairs and just as she knew. He’s not here. She was eager to tell me when I got home about an hour later. 


2. I’m laying in bed tossing and turning, can’t seem to get into that nice REM sleep. I’m half in half out of the covers have one leg hanging off the bed. I feel what I can only describe and something grab my foot. It didn’t pull me or anything just more so grabbed me like it wanted me to know it was there. Freaked me out I immediately grabbed my phone and turned on my flashlight. Nothing there. I woke my fiancé up and told her what just happened. She thinks I was just dreaming and didn’t respond much more than that. 

3. The strangest and clearest experience. I’m downstairs playing PS4, her and my youngest are upstairs asleep. My son is at my exes again. Volume is turned low on the T.V. I have on one earphone and am talking to my buddy on the mic. Clear as day, loud as a conversation you’d have with your friend sitting across the room from you I heard. “Hey Babe” from the top of the stairs. The hair on the back of my neck stands up and I am covered in goosebumps in under 10 seconds. I knew my fiancé and daughter were asleep, we have hardwood floors and I can hear her get up if she does. I also have a camera set up in our bedroom and my sons bedroom. The monitor is right in front of me sitting on top of my PlayStation. Look at the monitor. She’s in bed. Put the controller down, take off the headset. Sit there for a second. Verbally go, hell nah. No way. Walked upstairs with my flashlight and turned every light I passed on. Searched under the beds in the closet, Nothing. Sounded just like her, not muffled, not distorted. It was her voice. Didn’t even sound like someone trying to fake her voice I heard her clear as day. I opened the door to look at her and see if she was messing with me and she was out cold. No way it was her, but it sounded just like her??? What is it? A mimic? A shadow person ? What?

Last time I posted my experience here and thought the feedback was excellent. I just had SP minutes ago and thought I would share while it's fresh in my mind. 

My first dream (if that's the correct word, these SP dreams are so different than normal dreams, less story and more physical sensations) was that I was walking to the bathroom but right before I opened the door I collapsed on the ground in exhaustion. I have had this dream before. I was partially awake and was debating in my mind if this was really happening or just a dream. I concluded that it felt way too real to be a dream, it had to be real. I felt so logical in coming to that conclusion yet was wrong..it was a dream. 

Then right away a second dream (or perhaps this was all the same SP experience).  I was in my bed and a female voice answered yes. I don't remember what question I asked, unless it was related to me being on the floor or not. Then all of the sudden I am dancing in the air on top of my bed with what felt like a female entity (do entitys even have a gender? This sure felt like it). I was being held going around in circles. Not only did it not feel threatening, it felt very nice and comforting. The most pleasant SP I ever had. Yet I was partially awake and I thought maybe this is bad and should stop. I tried to speak. I wanted to say something like ""In the name of Jesus leave"". I am not religious at all yet I used that line one time during a bed shaking SP episode and it immediately stopped which amazed me. This time I was felt too paralyzed to say anything. I couldn't get the words out, so I continued this dance above my bed. Then I hear her say ""I know"" and it was over.   There are conversations in regular dreams but nothing as clear and realistic sounding as this ""I know"" that I heard.

So I'm not sure how to even begin to say this; this was a super weird experience and I guess I'd like to know if someone experienced something like this or has answers to my questions.

Last night was a really hot summer night and my window was wide open while I was at my PC. I heard a noise and realized there was a huge bug flying around my lamp and I freaked out (I'm genuinely scared of bugs). I ran to get the bug spray and sprayed all over the lamp until it died, but from far away, almost outside of my room.

Bug dead, I'm hyperventilating and decide to stay at the window to catch my breath and that's when I saw the most horrifing scene of my life. I live on the 5th floor and was checking the building in front of mine. This window caught my attention because I saw some movement and in a span of seconds there was someone climbing it, swinging a leg outside and throwing themselves.  

I panicked, my body instinctly turned away and I was waiting to hear the sound of them hiting the ground. But nothing happened. I looked back at the building entrance and couldn't see anything because there were a lot os trees. My whole body was shaking, I'm crying and was unlocking my phone to call the police but I'm also scared to do so because I didn't know if what I saw was real. 

Didn't call the police and decided to call my bf to tell him what I saw. He tried to calm me down and said that if there was nothing there, it probably was ""an ilusion"". I stayed on the call with him and went to bed but worried I'd listen sirens at any time. 

Next day (today) I woke up super early to hit the gym and saw that \*that window\* was closed. I was relieved and scared at the same time because I know what I saw, it wasn't like a blurred figure or anything, it was a legit person. Anyway, came home from the gym and started to check the building again. That's when I realized, all those windows has some kind of bars or safety nets, yet the one I saw last night had nothing. 

I'm planning to wait till night time to see if I can recognize wich apartment it was by the lighting and see if there's a net or something.

So... my questions are, you know, logically thinking... Could I have had an hallucination due to inhaling the bug spray? (I'd love to hear that inhalling small quantities of it could cause that). Has anyone ever experienced something like this? Was it a failed ""reality leap""/""bug in the matrix""?

I decided to post it on this sub because I just can't explain it, I felt such a terror and it was very real.

I sometimes predict things, have premonitions and I am highly sensitive  to situations and people around me. Last night I had this dream. It felt very real and I'm trying to make sense of it. This is it.

3 girls, 1 in her high teens, 1 in her low teens and a baby, around 3 or 4, found themselves in some kind of an accident, perhaps fire accident. All three escaped unhurt with bruises only. The girls then had to walk to the nearest town to get some help. Perhaps they live on the outskirts of somewhere.
When they reached the town, the residents already knew who they were. They found themselves being ignored and even verbally abused by the inhabitants of the town who did not believe what they went through.
The girls could not make sense of this. The residents knew all about them and they were treating them like they were regulars who always pestered them. The girls did not get the help they needed.

In my dream, as the viewer, I felt the residents of the town could predict the future. So it wasn't that they met the girls before. It's just that they have seen this incident before it actually happened.

Which leaves me with the following questions. 
- Why did they not help the girls? I could sense that what the girls went through was real. They did not fake the incident.
- Is there a real incident that you know similar to this?
- I could also sense that it was the residents of the town that were sinister and not the girls. Does this mean something?

I would like to mention here I do not own a TV and I haven't been to the cinema in over 7 years. The only things I watch are documentaries on you tube. 

This dream had too many details. Something that doesn't usually happen in dreams. The feelings I had were very real. For example, I felt the girls were honest and terrified they did not get help. I sensed the residents were sinister. I also felt that they could predict the future.
Just wondering whether I dreamt of something that actually happened, even though I never heard of it. Or whether my subconscious is trying to tell me something. 
It was certainly not a pleasant dream.

Among several other experiences that I can't explain that happened to me in my time there, there's one that still haunts me to this day. 

One day in the fall of 2005 I came home after school to watch some TV and unwind from another day in  the shitshow that was my freshman  year of high school.  I sat on the couch and turned on the TV and a strange image was displayed on it. Instead of our usual dish cable, there was an image of a room with white walls. The image seemed to be from, what I think to be, my own point of view. I could see 3 pairs of feet sticking out of the sheets at the end of a bed with an antique wrought-iron footboard...the exact same kind of footboard on my parents bed. The feet were that of a woman, a man, and a kid and looked eerily similar to my own feet and that of my mother and stepfather. Also in this room was a tall blonde man in a tan suit standing about ten feet away from the bed with his hands in his pockets, and he was looking away from us at this very large, disembodied face that was looking right at the screen. The weirdest thing is that the face was that of the tall blonde man.

At first I thought there was just something wrong with the TV or with the cable system, so I did some light troubleshooting. Just the simple stuff like turning the TV and cable box off and back on again. Nothing changed, not a problem. I thought I'd just unplug everything and that would reset things and I'd be back to flipping through the channels. I was wrong. I even tried unplugging the cable box while the TV was plugged in, and tried changing inputs to any of our 4 different inputs and nothing changed. This haunting image, with eyes that followed my every move, would not go away! Every time we turned on our TV, that was all we would see. This went on for 4 days.

We called dish, and by the time the technician came by, our TV had reverted back to normal function, and he said as far as he could tell there was never anything wrong with our cable box. We still don't know why the image was on our TV, or why we couldn't remove it on our own, but every now and then when I close my eyes I see the image I saw on the TV those days and the piercing eyes of the blonde man and it sends chills down my spine.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,933728,public,new,self,Strange man in my TV,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rf9smg/strange_man_in_my_tv/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I was young I had scary things I saw in my bedroom at night mainly a cloaked man who resembled death, would float out of the wall on one side of my room and go through the opposite side.

 It would be a nightly reoccurance to the point where I knew it would happen and I would hide under my covers sweating while knowing what was happening around me. It use to be a joke I slept in a cocoon.

I wouldn't just experience things like this at my house it would be at others as well. Once I was about 8 or 9 and had a sleepover at my cousins place. 

I remember waking up in the middle of the night, covers wrapped over my head so just my eyes and nose were visible. I noticed a pair of legs standing in front of my face. I felt imediate terror and couldn't bare to look up. I just pretended to be asleep and never spoke of it again.

At my grandparents house Id sleep over, again about 9 years old and would constantly have experiences of hearing footsteps coming to my door and then continuing down past my room. 

My door would be open so I could see no one was there. I one time woke up and was face to face with a dog but quickly wrapped the sheets back over my face and prayed it would go away.

Anyways all these experiences and more I had put off to being young, tired or just made up in my head because ghosts aren't real. Until last night which confirms all my experiences.

Well the other night I was sitting in my room reading with my dog on my bed as I usually do, it was about 12:30am. I then had heard a light thud at my door and when I had looked up my shower towel that hangs on the back of my door started swaying lightly.

 It then stopped for a second or 2 and began swaying a bit more aggressivley. At this point fear and terror took over and I yelled out ""spirit you are not welcome here!"" At that point I had said this the towel was thrown off the hooks on the back of my door putting scaring both me and my dog.

Since this has happened its validated that spirit is real and I've been trying to find answers but I don't really know where to look. Everyone I've spoken to don't seem to believe me or have some other far fetched explanation. This whole thing sounds like a joke and stupid but I have no explanation as to why or how this happened.

I should also add that there is no vent near my towel, windows are closed as it's winter and very cold, my door was closed so nothing external from the room could have effected it. I just feel alone and terrified every night.

This has happened to me more than a few times (enough so that my friends in college had a running joke about it). I say predictions because I'm not sure what other word to use. 

In college I majored in physics and statistics so I have a pretty thorough understanding of biases and likelihood of certain events. On that note one of the best examples I have of repeat predictions in a short time frame was playing a dice game with my friends in college. Objective of the game is not important but what is important is everyone is in a circle rolling 2 dice in turn. We were all having fun and joking around so I started trash talking (which makes no sense for a game of complete chance) and calling out the number pairs other people would roll. Funny thing was I was getting it exactly right over and over again. It spooked the hell out of one of my friends who was actually paying attention, and she started counting. All in all I got 38 correct dice predictions in a row only stopping when the game ended. 

The rational part of my brain says I was just getting lucky and having a good time but the much quieter part of my brain knows I wasn't. There was an odd feeling each time I would call a number pair, it's difficult to describe other than assured or confidant. And not like misplaced confidence, more like actually knowing to the point where any other outcome would be ridiculous.

Although, I haven’t had an experiences myself that could only be explained by the supernatural. Besides maybe this.

I had a dream where I was at my friend’s house and was walking to their garage where we’d smoke weed. Now that I think about it, that garage didn’t exist, it was a fabricated smoking room in my dream. Also, none of my friends were there.

Anyways, I open the door and I’m immediately paralyzed by this thing sitting and staring at me with white, piercing, bright eyes (with pupils), legs crossed on their futon. It’s eyes looked human, but like he put in white eye contacts.

His head was huge. Well, he was huge. You could tell he was imposing even though he was sitting down. Standing up, he’d be well over 7’. He had a goat head, but his horns were pointed down around his head and they were massive. They reached around the side of his face, almost touching at his chin.

He had a goat face but flatter and wider, with a black snout and bright red skin in other places across his face. Almost as if by design. Very similar to Darth Maul or the demon from Insidious. But it was his skin, not face paint.

He was wearing a black robe which covered most of his body, except his hoofs. He has hoofs like a goat and they were huge. I can’t remember his fur color, either brown, black, or red.

I don’t remember what his hands looked like. He wasn’t very expressive with them. He was calm and still when he spoke and didn’t move much. Which brings me to the next part.

I was paralyzed at first, until he started talking. He spoke with two voices, much like in exorcism movies. And boy, was he charming. Most charming and charismatic being I’ve ever spoken to. As soon as he started talking I was immediately calmed down. Everything I’d say he’d have a whitty and charming response.

He was so easy to speak with I didn’t even care that he resembled something out of Dante’s Inferno with a voice that was incredibly disturbing and unworldly. None of that mattered. He was chill as fuck.

I don’t remember what our conversation was about but I know we shot the shit for what felt like 5-10 minutes and then I left the room. I remember leaving on good terms with him. It felt like talking to an interesting friend. And then I woke up.

I felt confused waking up. On one hand, I just spoke with a demon. On another he was cool, interesting, and I didn’t get on his bad side.

Fast forward 8 months, I’m dating a Native American girl. I’ve always been fascinated with the paranormal and natives tend to be very open about that stuff, so I tell her about my dream.

As I’m describing the thing I spoke with, her eyes lit up. She eagerly tells me to finish my story before she lets me know anything.

After I’m done, she’s like, “holy shit, you spoke with Hoofman.” She then tells me her cousin recently had a dream where she was visited by him and described him in the EXACT same way. Darth Maul skin, robes, ect. and this was before I knew her much less her cousin.

Apparently Hoofman appears in your dreams and either just talks to you or asks you for something and if you say no, something terrible happens to you. I don’t think he asked me for anything, I never got the feeling of having to give up anything during my dream. I think we just kicked it.

Weird for me to dream about him as I’m not native, like, at all, (thank you 23&amp;Me) and I had no idea he existed.

This could totally be me making up this figure in my head, being influenced by the demon’s design on Insidious or something, but at that point I haven’t seen that movie for 8 years and I’ve only seen it once.

I’ve also heard your mind can’t make up faces in your dreams. Not sure how true that is but this thing definitely had a unique facial structure I’ve never seen before and it could emote like a human.

If anyone could give me insight on what I spoke with, what it means, or if it’s just my imagination, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Sorry this will be a long post. 

In 2019 my Grandpa passed away in the old farmhouse which was the homestead for multiple generations. He died of suicide. 

It came out of nowhere and took everyone by shock. He was a very stubborn independent man so it was assumed he preferred to die as opposed to being sent to a old-age home. He also was known to drink heavily time to time. My father and me found him in his rocking chair with the gun he used on his lap. 

Since then there has been a run of odd events happening in and around the farmhouse and yard. 

Early on it was little things - doors open that shouldn’t be. Unexplainable sounds in other parts of the house. One time I thought I saw my Grandpa in the mirror reflection behind me. Overall creepy vibes - Generic haunting stuff. 

I inherited the yard. It has been vacant since my grandpas death. I was excited to fix the yard up and start fresh. One day I was in the tree line cleaning up dead trees when I heard three distinct gun shots - like shots that seemed 50 yards away. I literally hit the ground. After a while I got up - there was no one around. About ten minutes later an old friend of my grandpa drove into the yard. I had known him for years. He pulled up and I asked him if he knew who was shooting. He said it wasn’t him and he saw no one around. He didn’t seem himself. He was usually a happy guy but on this day he seemed distracted - like he was in a fog. He said to me “are you sure you should live here?” I said yes that I was excited to rebrand the yard. Not long after he left. About a month later he died of a stroke. 

The day following the gunshots, my daughter (5 at the time) and I were in the old house. She was playing with a toy train while I was cleaning. She abruptly stood up and said “I want to go home”. I followed her out of the house and helped her into my truck. She asked me if I could go get her train. When I went back into the house it was like walking into a different universe. It was freezing cold. I could see my own breath. The house was the same but the colors were different - almost muted. I was freaked out and left the house. When I left the house I heard thumping on the walls and the siding of the house started flapping. Freaky stuff. 

I got in my truck and sped out. When we were a couple miles away I stopped and asked my daughter what she saw - she said she saw a man with a pointy hat in the house. She hasn’t been allowed in the yard since. 

I returned later that night (stupid I know) I took pics of the house and when I looked at them later there appears to be a shadow figure with a pointed hat looking at me. I can only see it in pictures not real-time. 

I met with a pastor and he told me that what I was describing - change in temperature, muted colors are tells of demonic activity. He agreed to pray and anoint/bless the house. When we went to the house I was expecting fireworks - but nothing happened. In fact it was calm and peaceful. I was optimistic things were better. Things were better for some time. 

To clarify the house is vacant but my father and I still have cattle on the yard. Here’s what has been happening over the past year: 

- when I am on the yard I have unexplained phantom pain in my left hand - only when I’m on the yard nowhere else. A stabbing pain in the palm of just my left hand 

- there was a large dead coyote in our shop - no evidence of how it got there 

- one day my dad drove into the yard and found our large bull trapped in a bale feeder

- we found a cow dead with a broken neck in the corral. When I approached the carcass my left hand began to throb. I could smell a unique scent not associated with livestock. I’ve been around dead animals - this was a different smell

This all leads to me posting here. We have attempted spiritual intervention and things seem to be getting worse. 

Questions: 

- does anyone know any significance of the pointed hat demon ? I know of “hat man“ but this isn’t sleep paralysis linked 

- can anyone the phantom pain in my left hand? 

- what is the significance of the three gunshots? My grandpa was an avid hunter - was this a warning from him?

Sometimes, when I’m not focusing on anything or zoning out, I get a first person perspective look at an environment. Like, me standing in a certain place while a certain thing is happening. It’s not like I’m actually there, I just see it in my minds eye. I don’t think anything of it until days later when I find myself in the exact position I envisioned before, with the exact same thing happening. It’s an intense feeling of deja vu. Because I’m such a skeptic, I don’t write any of the images I get down because there are plenty of them that don’t come true right away. And then I think that maybe I’m just thinking of common environments and then I go there. But when the thing I envisioned happens, I can always tell. It’s more than deja vu, it’s like getting chills or a sense of being unnerved. Why do I feel this way if I’m not even convinced whats happening is real? Sometimes I can remember exactly when I envisioned it, sometimes I just get the unnerving feeling and I know that I must have seen it at some point, even if I’ve forgotten when. 

The strange part about this is that I talked to my biological mother about it years ago and she says the exact same thing happens to her. I haven’t brought it up since then, but I’m going to.

I didn’t know the area though seeing as I had just gotten my license about 5 months prior and didn’t live on this side of town. I did pay attention as we were driving there however because we live down south and if you know the backroads you can get from one county to the next and so on without touching a main road so I was eager to learn these.

It was like I was outside, but inside at the same time. 

I was standing with this very tall, very thin and very very pale woman. Like, her skin was almost pure white, her hair was white and almost glowing, her eyes were wide, unblinking and milky white/blue. Her lips were thin and she never talked at all, but I had this sense of feeling like she was calm and relaxed, even though she looked bored. She had pale blue clothing on, and silver boots. 

I was standing there, talking to her, and my hair was very long, almost as long as hers, (my hair is really really short irl), and I was bleaching it to be the same colour as hers. My mom approached us, and she kept looking at the tall woman. The pale woman didn't look at my mom, didn't say anything to her, but instead approached me, and was touching my shoulder and looking directly at me. 

I could tell that my mom was uncomfortable around this woman, and had asked me when I was done with my hair. I had told my mom that I was just going to rinse it out now, and I walked over to this very wide, very shallow metal bin, and rinsed out my hair. My mom was standing near this woman, and was considerably shorter than her. For context, my mom is 5'10, and this woman easily was almost a foot and a half taller. 

I approached my mom when I was done, and my mom grabbed my arm, and started walking away, dragging me along with her. My mom kept looking behind her shoulder at this woman, seeing if she was going to follow us, and had told me that she was looking for me for a very long time. 

I cant explain it exactly, but when I was with that pale woman, I felt like I was very calm, and that I didn't have to worry about what time it was. I felt very safe with this woman, even though the surrounding area was very dark looking, and I'm scared of the dark. It was if she was talking to me, but she wasn't moving her lips or I didn't hear a voice in my head. But I was able to communicate with her. 

I told my mom about this dream and she says that the woman was an alien, but after I had told one of my friends, my friend said that it was a ghost.

This is in a small town of Colorado, with its only real claim to fame being a big hole in the ground. I moved in with a buddy of mine who I knew in high school and all was well for a while. My friend needed to move out of state, leaving me to a cycle of replacements to cover his part of bills. The last room mate I had, I had almost no contact with, but he managed the money and mostly kept in his room at the back of our place. 

Eventually, one day I get a knock on the door. Police with a warrant step inside to his room, cuff him and leave. I still don't know what it was about, but I haven't heard from him since. The police interaction was the last straw for my landlord and recieved a 3 day court mandated eviction. While cleaning his room, I removed mostly trash, a tool box that was mainly screw drivers and what seems like a sketch book or journal that he might have bound himself.

Until recently, when I found it in the top of a closet I was expanding, I had completely forgotten about it.. I have no idea how it made it through the the cleaning and subsequent moves over the last decade. I can think of at least 3 places I lived, not to mention couch hopping, yet somehow this book made it through? I'm not sure where to start researching this thing, but the pen work is so detailed and painstaking, I felt it must be something of note.

I see a ring of small mushrooms all aligned in a perfect circle, not knowing any better I decide to play around in and out of the circle. I even rip some of the mushrooms out of the circle but drop them on the ground due to my sensory issues. About a few minuets probably went by, since I was too young to tell time or mentally count time, I hear some giggling from my grandmas neighbors yard. The neighbors yard is untrimmed and wild with several bushes larger than myself in the yard. I see a brief glimpse of what I thought at the time were 4 red pointed hats like that of garden gnomes, so I obviously freaked and ran to my grandma and grandpa. However when they came out to look at what I described to them as living garden gnomes they saw nothing and heard nothing. The little gnomes vanished and I never had a encounter with them again. Fast forward to my early 20s and I learn about a fae from England known as redcaps, which fit the exact description of these little would be kidnappers. Reason why I say kidnappers is because these things apparently kidnapped folk and killed them hence why they wore red caps. There’s a wiki on these things and would love to hear your opinions.

For some reason you can talk about ghosts, demons, and aliens with more credibility. 

My life has been filled with things that I think would be called fairies.

When it tried to touch me it shot off like it hit an electric fence, and hit the hall by my big sisters room so hard she woke up cuz the sound. 


The second  instance was when I was 10 years old and walking through the woods with my mother, her bf, and four of my siblings when I noticed something in a tree. 
I pointed at it to my little sister and she declared it to be a fairy. My whole family is now standing there and staring at this Robin sized light shaped like a person. My mothers bf was jumping through hoops trying to rationalise it. At first he thought it was a firefly, except it was too big and didn’t blink. Then he thought it a small mirror stuck in the tree, and except it flew away, and mirrors don’t do that. It was lit up the whole time. 

The third instance would be when my son was just born, and we were lying in bed together. I woke up cuz I thought my cat hopped up onto the bed. I felt it walking up and over my leg when I suddenly heard a little voice go “it’s a baby”, like “itsa baaybee”. 

This caught me off guard, and scared the living hell out of me so I instinctually kicked. I felt whatever it was as my foot made contact with it, and I punted the lil dude towards the wall of my bedroom, making a thud like a beanie baby or what not. 

I jump up, turn on the light, and start patting at the floor and apologising but couldn’t find anything. 

This isn’t the only paranormal thing to happen, as my son literally has a double that’s been seen by dozens of people in multiple states, and wonder if the double could be a type of fairy too since the fairy I punted was interested in my son as an infant, and then there was a copy of him from age 3-15.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,933507,public,new,self,I accidentally punted a fairy across the room,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rexk26/i_accidentally_punted_a_fairy_across_the_room/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I lived in this 6 bedroom house which has always had an eerie feeling but being so young I didn't pay too much attention to it since my mind was on other things like Super Nintendo and things like that. Well, one sunny day I was up in my room cleaning it (which I rarely did). I had the curtains pushed back so the sun could come in. When I was finished, I stood in the middle of the room admiring it and suddenly this white cloud floats around me. It looked exactly like a small white cloud. It scared the bejeezus out of me and I don't even remember touching one step while flying down the stairs in terror. 
I've tried looking this up but couldn't find anything. Does anyone know what type of entity it could be?

What my issue here is that I haven’t see them in a while after my third encounter and I want to see them again. I liked the feeling of them being around me even if its for less then a second,
I also want to see them again because I seemed to be more “lucky” after i would encounter one
For example I would see this creature or entity in the corner of my eye, it disappear and a week later I would see a 900% return on a stock option or another example would be when my ex who I still had feelings for randomly message me on a Tuesday morning just a few days after seeing it.

Suddenly I see a pack of Rottweilers in the middle of the road so I slow down to a stop.

They don’t move even though I was driving a truck and I was about 30 feet away from them. They just look at me for a few seconds.

I found it strange so I stopped my truck to see what would happen. They immediately come up and start circling my truck. I left after that, didn’t want them to damage my truck and I was a little freaked out.

To this day I still wonder what happened. Why is there a pack of a specific breed of dog out in the middle of the night? Why didn’t they move? Why did they circle my truck?

I guess there could have been a breeder close by, but that would mean all of their dogs got out at the same time in the middle of the night and displayed pack behavior, circling my truck.

Very odd, wondering what this might have been and if there is any under lying meaning.

It was a house I moved to just after my divorce, and so I tried to make it as happy a place as possible after a frankly horrible marriage.

So, I noticed a few things within the first month. I didn't used the spare room apart from junk storage, so the door was always closed. When standing at the kitchen door having a cigarette, you'd hear footsteps from the spare room above. I'm very interested in the paranormal due to an experience as a child (another story for another time). I used to knock on the wall in the kitchen, only to have it replicated from the floor above. The room itself wasn't somewhere I liked to be, it felt unwelcoming.

I also used to get the immediate smell of stale cigarettes on the landing. Now alot point out I smoke in the kitchen, but that's always with the back door open. I never smoke indoors. You'd walk up the stairs into the stench. Then without warning it would just go. More than once I seen a shadow leaning over the bannisters looking down the staircase at me. Never managed to catch it on camera sadly.

Perhaps the one that scared me the most was the woman who appeared in my bedroom. I was coming out of the shower, walked into my room to see her standing beside the window. The first thing I noticed was how she was dressed in a long button up 70s style dress and an pinafore apron. She looked me dead in the eyes for what seems like an eternity (probably only a second or two) then vanished.

Now, fast forward a few years, and my current partner had a friend who called over. She was very into pagan stuff and had a knack for sencing ghosts. I asked if she'd take a walk around to see if she could feel anything in my house. I stress, I had t told her of what I'd experienced.
She felt three people in the house. One, an older lady who hadn't died in the house, but had lived there. Another was a younger man who had died in the spare room. The third she said was in the attic, but she couldn't get a reading from it.

Finaly, I did a little digging. I found that while the house wasn't very old, there had been a woman who was born in it, lived in it all her life, and died in the mid 1980s of lung cancer. Her grandson had lived there after her, but he died a few years later of a drug overdose.

As I move on to pastures new with my soon to be new wife, I'm reminded of everything that went on here. The lights going on and off, the knocks, the smell of cigarettes, door handles rattling, and electrical equipment coming on randomly, and of course the old woman showing herself in my bedroom. It frightened me, but I slowly learned to live with it.

My friend, for the sake of the story we’ll call him jim. Anyway one night Jim and I were talking and playing video games, when he asks if he should do a seance, now me, a 15 or so year old who didn’t belive in all this said yes….

Then we get in a video call, he walks to his cupboard, and pulls out a red candle and a crow feather, I have no clue as to why he has these so easily accessible. But anyway, he lit the candle and invited spirits to talk to him. 
He was very polite to them, and I wanted to stir them a bit, so I decided I would antagonise and provoke the spirit/s he was talking to.

Nothing happened and we went to sleep. 

I woke the next morning and talked to him, he tells me that he hs a dream of an angel, all black with no face and huge black wings. ( if this means anything, please tell me, I’ve always been curious about it )
And nothing had happened to me so I shrugged it off.
This is when it all began…

My room set up was… weird… I had my gaming desk and gaming chair at one end next to my bed, facing the other end of my room, and at the other end of my room was a couch. 
Some nights I would feel as though someone were watching me and I would look over at the couch and get full body shivers, I’m getting them just talking about it. And that was a bit creepy, but what’s creepier is that, we had 3 cats and a dog in the house, my cat would always chill in my room, and one night I was petting her and whatnot, and all of a sudden her bed darted to the side, and she stared at the chair, after about 10 seconds I decided I’d try and get her attention, so I was saying oi and making noises and stuff, but she didn’t look at me, she just stared, although eventually she came around, but she would still glance over there some times.

That was experience one… this happened a few times and with each of the cats, they would often just stare at the couch. And one night I was in the hallway petting my dog, I like to pet my animals idk lmao. Anywho I was petting him and he was enjoying it. Then his head looked behind me to my room, I looked, nothing there, then he traced something that walked all the way from my room, right behind me and into the living room, I watched his head follow something that whole way…

But all of this is not the worst of it. 

This is where it gets worrying to me, I thought it would be a good idea to prevoke whatever was there, so I did. And again nothing happened. 

From this point on I had an experience, whenever I got the urge to look over at the chair I would get the goosebumps, but also something else, I don’t know exactly how to explain it so for lack of a better word I’ll say pressure, my whole body would get really heavy and the shivers and goosebumps were intense my whole body felt like it had a mass of pressure on top of it.
It was scary to be honest

It even escalated, and this may be irrelevant or coincidence but I woke up one morning with a severe chest pain, one of the worst pains I’ve ever felt. Long story short, I went to hospital in an ambulance. I explained what I was feeling and the doctors had no clue what it was , they said it wasn’t any medical condition they’d come across before, and said it may just be an abnormal pain from an activity or something idk.

But nothing worse happened after that. 

But I still feel it and get the pressure when I look there to this day…

It's been nearly a year and man was I not expecting this amount of activity.

It stared at the beginning of December, when my mom was walking past her room and Suddenly jumped, she claimed she saw a dark haired little girl sitting on her bed and told us she didn't look right. That 'her face was all dark, like she was wearing a black mask.'

Since then, we've been getting a lot of activity, seeing things in the corner of our eyes, our Xbox turning on by itself, things disappearing and then reappearing, things moving on their own. And recently we've started hearing voices. But not like little girls or anything like that, we've been hearing family members voices. Last night my mom claimed she heard my brother screaming for help when really he was sleeping in his room, and while I was doing dishes I thought I heard my mom calling me from the living room when she was actually in her room sleeping. And I thought I saw something standing in the corner of my brothers room. It was tall, and completely dark. Like some kind of shadow monster and I felt watched the whole time afterwards.

So, I really need to know, is this entity dangerous? It hasn't done anything bad, but it is starting to scare us.

She had been sick after gallbladder surgery in September and was in and out of the hospital. Her death came as a shock. My dad,  brother and husband all live in her childhood home. We’ve been here for 3 years now. So this week we had been getting everything together for my moms funeral and it has been very hard. My mom and I were best friends and I can’t believe she’s gone.  We would often sit in her room and I helped her when she was sick at home and would do anything to help her like cook for her, get her medicine for her and we just liked to watch our shows together. I was at the hospital with her also each and every day bc like I said my mom was my world. Well getting back to my story, last Tuesday my dad, brother and I had went shopping for clothes to bury her in. We picked an outfit that was definitely her style. We got home and I went into her room to hang up the clothes. Now my mom has about 7 balloons in her room helium ones that I have brought for her some since she’s was alive and a few since her passing. She loved the balloons and just like to have them. Well I notice that one of the balloons my dad mentioned earlier that was on the top of the ceiling that hadn’t moved for  months was over her light in her room. I call my dad and brother and the balloon starts to move across the room  ( a pink heart balloon) and it moves right back into the original spot where it had been for months. My dad and I and brother said that was my mom letting us know she’s okay and she’s happy with what we are doing for her. Now Friday I go back in her room to check her balloons and another pink star has moved over by the heart balloon and my brother and I watch as it moves around her room, makes it way to our pictures and exits the room where it floats over some more of our pictures in the dining room, a pic of her deceased mom and aunts and finally makes way passed a picture of Jesus and stops by the light in the room. I tell my brother that’s mom again. This happened at 7 ish in the morning and we go upstairs until and come back down at 11 ish. The balloon is gone my brother says when he goes in dining room to check. I was like in the kitchen at that time and turn to see the ballon is resting on the counter where my moms soup and beans are.

I'm sorry this post is so long.

There have been a few times in my life where I have knowledge of something that I knew would happen, but it was so random.   I have a few theories I would like to postulate after I describe some instances of these things:

1.  I'm a huge lottery gambler.   I know...it's a waste of money.   I play Fantasy 5 quite a bit here in California, which is five numbers between 1 and 39.   I was going to bed one night, and just as I'm about to doze off a ""knowledge"" came to me.   out of nowhere.   I wasn't even thinking of the lottery, and I never pick my own numbers.....I get quick picks.  But in my brain, I had the absolute knowledge that the numbers 12 and 13 would come up in the next day's drawing.   It was so random!    But I knew it would happen, as sure as I knew the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  So, the next day I went to the store, got a ticket with every one of the five lines having 12 &amp; 13, and then I picked random numbers for the rest.   Well.....it was both a surprise and not a surprise when I checked the numbers that night to see that 12 &amp; 13 did show up that day.   However, I didn't hit a single other number, so I won five quick picks.   haha.  
2. In the same vein of the lottery gambling, I have two friends who have crap jobs, and I told them that we should each pick a number for something called Daily Derby (horses between 1 and 12, and you pick the horses coming in 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and you also pick the race time which is a number between 1 and 999.    So, my friends picked 12 and 6.   and I picked 9.   And I put it on a play slip so we picked three games in one draw with 12/6/9, and the race times were random, so one slip had three games for each draw.   Well, I played it for a while, and nothing came of it, and I left it in my car glove compartment.  One night randomly as I was driving home months and months later, I suddenly got the urge to play the slip.   It was booming inside my head to play that slip that night.   So, I pulled into the CVS, retrieved the slip.   I got out of my car, and said to myself, ""Why the heck would you waste money?   So, I opened the car and put the slip back in and closed/locked the door again.    And the voice in my head said, ""you'll regret it!   It's going to come up tonight!"".   So, I opened the car again, exclaimed to myself that this is crazy...and the voice said to play the slip twice, and I actually said out loud, I am not going to waste $84 tonight!    So, I played the slip once.   And again...surprised but not surprised, 12/6/9 showed up and I won $1,200.   But I didn't get the race time which would have been a quarter million.   so close.....so far.
3. Many years ago (2004), I lived in Long Beach next to the ocean in a  tall apartment complex on the top floor (5 floors tall).    I went to sleep that night and had a very very vivid dream that a tsunami hit Long Beach, and I was saved because I was on the top floor.   When I went to work that next morning after the dream I saw on the news that the massive tsunami struck in the Indian Ocean and killed hundreds of thousands of people.   Random that I dreamed of a massive tsunami striking California at the same time that a worldwide catastrophe happened, no?.

So, my question to you all is.....what is the nature of the universe?   Where did those premonitions come from?   I am telling you that when I had them, it was absolute knowledge...not like a guess.  It was like I knew truth.   And for the tsunami dream, I never ever remember my dreams, but this one was so huge that I couldn't stop thinking about it after waking up.    I have a couple theories, and would like to hear your opinions:   

a.  We are all connected in this world in some unknown way.    Knowledge in one person is transmitted to others if they are receptive enough.   This might explain how people have knowledge of foreign lands and other people having never been there.   

b.  Our brains can, in some way, hear radio waves and understand/translate them, so the news reports of the tsunami was heard subconsciously as it was happening around the world.     This would explain the tsunami thing, but if this is how I got the lottery ones, too, does that mean that the lottery isn't random and is picked by people controlling distribution of money through gambling?   

c.  I was raised Catholic (God/Devil/Angels/Demons), and my knowledge of the lottery numbers ""given to me"" was done so either by God to send me a message to stop wasting time on stupid things like that, or done so by the Devil to taunt me.....get me close but keep me far away and thus makes me gamble even more.    My family (very religious) would even go so far as to say that turning toward gambling would indicate my lack of faith in God and His Divine Will.    They would say the same thing about any type of mysticism where you try to gain knowledge through anything other than prayer.

d.  With regard to (c) above, I once played with an Ouija board with my book club (7 girls and myself).   It was halloween and I suggested it.   The three of us with our hands on the board had never played before.   We knew that if her roommate came back home, we needed to hide the board so as not to freak her out.  Something that called itself Elizabeth started communicating with us, telling us she died in 1928.   It even corrected us when we asked 1918?   In the middle of answering a question, the planchette just stopped moving, and we were confused until 10 seconds later we heard the jingle of the key in the door.   had it not stopped moving we wouldn't have had time to hide the board before roommate walked in.   After she left to go clubbing (you know those LA actresses and their hedonistic lifestyle!!!!!), we played again, but this time it ""felt weird"".  It felt darker.   When asked if it was still Elizabeth, it said no, and when we asked its name, it spelled out Z-A-Z-A.   I have seen this show up multiple times throughout the world when I googled it.   Most of my friends found this titillating, but it actually terrified me.   As I mentioned before I grew up catholic, and when hearing sermons, I would hear God described as ""the beginning and the end"".  So, when I saw this ZAZA, instead of a name, I read it as the Devil telling me that I am the end.....and I am the beginning.   Meaning, that while God created the universe, the devil would triumph in the end.

I had just moved into a new house and everything was going very smoothly. It was a foggy morning. I had just woken up and opened the shades on my windows. That is when I first saw the figure, walking down a path in my backyard. 

It wasn't a normal apparition of him though. It was white in appearance, and translucent, almost as if it was using the fog as a physical form. It had the typical top hat, suit, and cane. I watched as it walked down the path and toward the back door, which I could not see from my room due to other parts of the house blocking it.

A few days later, I noticed some things were off in my house. At night, I could hear footstep noises coming from the attic above my room. A toy slot machine (which I still have) would also start up at random intervals every night. These things eventually stopped after about a year or so.

Fast forward 6 years later. I had not seen the man for a while. My last pc had recently shorted, so I had just gotten a replacement. Instead of keeping it upstairs where it was before, I decided to move it into the basement, where I have all of my consoles. I figured it would be more convenient that way. I rarely went down there beforehand.

Before I continue, I will describe the layout of my basement. The stairs go down, and to the left is the area I am in, and the other way leads to a garage. My desk is on the left wall of the staircase, so to my left is where the stairs reach the floor.

I'm chilling for a few days, setting up my new stuff every day after school. I keep noticing movements near the end of the staircase, but shrug them off.

I had finally gotten my pc set up. I was having some technical issues with my pc, where it wasn't letting me connect to the internet, even with an ethernet cable. I was sitting with my chair rotated a bit, so I could more clearly see the staircase.

That was when I saw him again. He was the standard jet black this time. I saw the cane pop out from around the corner, then him slowly turning to look at me, then dissipating into shadows. My pc issues were gone.

I decided to look more into this figure in the recent days. Everyone that encounters him says something bad happens either before or after seeing him. I'm unsure as to why either nothing happens or something positive happens like in that one case. I also do not know why he showed up in the fog that day.

Ever since I moved into the basement, I have been seeing him around once a week. Usually it is not a full appearance, just an arm, leg, or his cane sticking out from the corner, then retracting when I look at it. It's almost as if he's trying to remind me that he is there. The last time I saw him was earlier today.

Now, my life is good. I live with my fiancé and our cat and dog. I've been getting my mental health in order. Because of my life, I have NEVER believed in god. Always made dark jokes about Jesus and god because I thought religion was funny. 

I just woke up drenched in sweat from a dream, and in it Jesus visited me. 

In the dream, I was staying up at night because I knew Jesus was coming to visit me. Eventually I got tired of waiting, so I looked at the clock and saw that it was 4:36AM. I gave up and decided to go to bed, when suddenly Jesus came through my front door. He was absolutely gorgeous, and refused to look at me directly. He kept his head turned away from me the entire time. The room was immediately filled with a bright, bright yellow light, but oddly enough the light didn't hurt my eyes. I felt nothing but overwhelming terror and fear. The fear I felt was so strong, and so real that I thought I'd die from fear. I immediately fell to my knees and started praying, ""Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name..."" and so on so forth. I just kept thinking to myself, ""I'm a sinner. I've sinned. I didn't believe in Jesus and now here he is in front of me.""

Jesus didn't have much emotion that I could tell. He just stood there while I knelt and prayed, and he said to me, ""It's ok. I once acted the same way when I was starving.""

It was so, so strange because somehow I knew what he meant. He wasn't saying that I was *literally* starving, he was implying that I was lacking essential things in my life. I was starved of love, starved of faith or hope, starved of belief. Then, he turned and he left.

Way too loud to be a bird, especially at night. My grandpa was always pestering my grandma about making sure the windows were locked at night even though they live in a pretty safe neighborhood.
 A few days after that a clock which my grandma's has longer then I've been alive started talking. The clock had never done this... ever and it was repeating bible verses. After that one time, we've never heard it again.
Fast forward to a month and my grandma has a camera in her back yard now. At this point she has my grandpa's ashes and they've been sitting in his chair. One morning, my grandma woke up to a notification from the camera. She opened it and captured a bright light lifting from the shed and passing though the back yard almost illuminating all of it before decending slightly and disipearing.

If this is still sensitive, maybe come back to my story another time :)

The most significant time this happened was just a couple years ago, 2019 maybe? I grew up next door to an older couple, and the old man had been sick for a little less than a decade. He was very important to my dad and my dad would visit him occasionally even after he eventually moved from that house.

I was at work one day and had a sinking feeling majority of the morning I couldn’t shake. Later that afternoon I had a sudden feeling this neighbor did not have much longer to live, and I called my dad from a Starbucks parking lot to tell him to connect with this neighbor soon because I had a feeling he did not have much time left. Keep in mind I lived two states away and had not connected in any way to these neighbors in about four years at this point. I had no way of knowing this. My dad kind of believed me but he didn’t immediately go visit this neighbor or anything.

A month later this neighbor was in hospice and my dad had called me to tell me he probably would not make it through the night. Thankfully my dad went to visit upon hearing the news and caught him while he was conscious in the hospital. My dad asked me how I knew and I just don’t have any idea, I just did.

Similar experiences happened when I was in my early teens. My dad had a good friend who would purchase a coca-cola for me every time he saw me. I always appreciated it and one day I received the coke and made eye contact with the man and just knew it was the last time I’d ever experience this. I did not tell anybody, and in hindsight I’ve learned to always listen to this feeling so I can prepare people around me. This man passed away about a week or two later. He was in his late forties, and we believe he had a stroke in his sleep. 

This situation is less immediate but I believe it’s related. Growing up in my early to mid teens, I was best friends with two girls. I remember I often had extremely sinking feelings at night that something might happen to one of them. I would text them and ask them if they were okay, and I would request that they tell me they were safe. I bet they thought I was crazy sometimes lol.

I fell off with one of them when we were about 17. She was going through a hard time and got into drugs. I don’t blame her but it just wasn’t my scene.

We were trying to reconnect when I was about 20. She was 6 months sober and we happened to both be in our home town at the same time. It didn’t work out that we’d see each other in person, but I had a feeling I just needed to tell her things I felt I owed her an apology for, and I wanted to get some things off my chest I had not been able to tell her since we had fell off. It was a good text conversation.

She passed away three weeks later after being hit by a drunk driver.

I’ve learned to listen to these feelings always, as well as to my lack of them. My husband’s father is having open heart surgery in a week, and I haven’t been anxious at all about his surgery. I just have a feeling everything will be okay.

Anyways getting to the point, I have 4 dolls, and one of the doll's eyes were painted to so they can't close or anything. The other 2 has brown eyes and the fourth one blue. I had got the 2 dolls with brown eyes around the same time last year. 

&amp;#x200B;

And one of their eyes had turn bright red, and a lot of people had said it was because of direct contact with the sun/lights. The thing is, I don't play with these dolls. I haven't even touched them in like what, 6 or 7 months? And like I said earlier they stay in my closet, which has no light or light switch. So I wanna know how one of my dolls eyes turned my red and the other one with brown eyes didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  don't think the brightness is the only thing causing the eyes to turn red. I think it's because of the brand the eyes came from. Whatever brand they put in the eyes of the dolls is the reason why they change color I think. I asked my mom what I should do and she recommended a brown fine point sharpie but I don't have one.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it's normal if they change color, even though it's creepy, don't throw them away. I say try contacting the company to see what they say. And if it's a 'My Generation' or 'My life' doll, do expect some color change in the eye's. Doll eyes might turn from brown to violet/indigo or red.

I have so many stories from there that, to me, prove that it's indeed haunted, but I'll begin with the oldest one I can remember, before there even was a house there.

1) Right next to the house there's a kindergarten. I studied there when I was a kid, just like my mom and her brothers before me. 

There was always a playground legend about a man in military uniform who called the kids to go behind the school and then they disappeared.

Even as a kid, I remember being so afraid of going to that part ular place behind the school, but as I grew I stopped thinking about it.

Fast forward a few years, and the my uncle's house had just been finished. One night, when I was out doing laundry with my cousin, I decided I wanted to see the kindergarten from above, as it had been years since I saw it on the inside, so we go into the balcony and get a really good view of the place, and after a few seconds I notice someone walking in between the classrooms and the back of the school, I couldn't see their face but my whole body tensed as I saw the shadow go through the wall and then disappear behind the school. I remembered the story from my childhood and still wonder if that is the same man the kids saw back then.

2) Most of the paranormal experiences I've had, have been with said cousin I mentioned earlier, so I do believe her when it comes to paranormal things she's told me that happen in my uncle's house. 

One of the scariest ones for her, was a time when she had just came home from school and wanted to ask her aunt (let's call her Sara) if they were going to eat at her grandparent's house or if they would be staying there. 

So, she goes to the bottom of the stairs and yells ""Aunt Sara! Are you here?"" 

To which Sara's voice responded  ""Yes"" 

Then my cousin yelled again ""Are we gonna go to grandma's?"" but no one answered after that. 

After a few minutes without a response, my cousin went to the second floor and started looking for Sara, but there was absolutely no one there, not a single person. She then called her on the phone only to find out that they had all gone to her grandparent's house and were waiting for her to go as well. She ran out of there, and didn't come back for weeks as she was too afraid of the voice she heard. 

I wasn't present when this happened, but it's important to the next story, where I was present.

3) After those, and a bunch of other paranormal things happened to her and our family, they decided they would call a priest to bless the house and invited everyone to pray and later hang out with them. My whole family was there, 20+ people in the backyard as the priest blessed the house. 

We were all praying and singing, happy, united, when suddenly, just as the priest was going to climb the stairs to the 2nd floor, a loud voice sounded as if it was coming from where we were standing, and it said ""GO AWAY"". 

My 14 year old self was shaking with fear, but the lady that was directing the prayer yelled at us to pray louder and take each other's hands, a lot of people were crying, with horror at what we had just witnessed. That has to be one of the scariest things I've ever lived. 

And for that I'm convinced that there something horrible, hiding in my uncle's house.",True,False,False,Paranormal,t5_2qjxn,933193,public,new,self,There's something in my uncle's house,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/red8r9/theres_something_in_my_uncles_house/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone, my first post in this sub (actually, my first post at all)

When I was about 10-12, I had a series of experiences I would like to share. There are multiple elements in my story that sound like cliches, but I'm totally serious with this. I think it does not sound as scary as many other stories in this sub I read in the last days, but for me it really was.

&amp;#x200B;

I lived with my parents and my younger brother in a single family home in the south-west of Germany. It was an old house. We moved in when I was 7 and as far as I can remember, there was everything fine the first three years. When I was 10, the room of me and my brother where on the second floor, my parents room was in the basement. Above us, there was just the attic. Around this time, my brother and I started to hear some cracking from up there. Only at night, maybe once a week. The sounds changed over time and got more frequent. It sounded like ""steps"" at this point. Like someone is walking up and down. We both clearly heard the source of the sound was not static and kind of moving. We heard it maybe every second night at this point, sometimes every day for multiple weeks. Nothing to weird at this point, many children confuse normal sounds with creepy stuff at night. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The door to the stairs up there were next to my door. Basically, it was just a small room containing only the stairs. You can be damn sure I was always checking twice this door was locked when I came home from school and before going to bed. When I was 12, my parents went to the birthday of a friend. It was not uncommon to let me and my brother alone at such events, as we were really calm and we did no weird shit alone, except for staying up to long. At this time, my brother and I had separat rooms. My brother moved in the third and last room at this floor. I was laying in bed and heard an audio book on CD. It was about 1am, lights out. The CD stopped and I wanted to start the next one, so I stood up and went to the stereo. For some reason, I thought at this exact moment about whether I have checked the lock of the door to the small room when I heard something from the hallway. The doorknob was pressed down really loud and the door to this tiny room scratched slowly over the floor. I say ""scratched"" because it was hard to open and close this door. If you would leave it half open in the morning, it would habe been half open in the evenning. No way it would close by itself, let alone open. I was scared and completely frozen and just stood there. I had the feeling every second would someone or something come in my room. Felt like hours, but probably was just half an hour. Then I heard the door scratching over the floor again and the door lock clicking. After another 5min or so, I took all my courage, ran to the door and locked it. Finally, my parents came home and I was able to sleep like 2 hours later. They said I can tell them tomorow, must have been a bad dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next day it was not necesarry to ask my brother whether he heard the same thing. He seemed really frightend. This was no joke of him. We told our parents. Needless to say they did not believe us. We complained earlier about the attic, but never as serious as this time. Got really paranoid after this. Checked the door like 5 times a day. When my mother would go up there, I was waiting for her to come back to lock the door immediately. One evening about a month later, I walked past this damn door when again the doorknob was pressed from the other side. Something heavy pressed against the door from the other side. It moved like half a centimeter in my direction, but thanks god it was locked. The doorknob was pressed as second time before I run to my parents downstairs in the living room. I cried. They didn't take is seriously, but my dad agreed to go upstairs. There was nothing. Nothing that could have moved the door, no burglars, no homeless guy or whatever. I still think today about what I would have seen if the door would not have been locked. 

&amp;#x200B;

About this time I started to hear a breathing sound. It was not like breathing, it was breathing. Breathing in and out, like breathing deep through the nose. I heard it every time I turned off the lights in my room. Only in my room, only when I was alone. It would stop when the lights were turned on, but started shortly when turning them off again. It came from a dark corner of the room, but not the same corner every time. Was also very scary, not sure whether it has something to do with the other stuff. I slept with a small light until I moved out when I was 22. Really, like a little child

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today I am 28, work as research assistant and persue a PhD, people around me would describe me as pretty rational. I shared the apartment for 6 years with my best friend. She moved out two weeks ago and I am living alone for the first time. The reason I started to think about this topic again and wanted to write it down, and this is by no mean some creepy bullshit plottwist at the end: I started to hear the breathing again. Coming from the now empty room. I can hear it when I go to the toilet next to this room and once I heard it from the hallway. I am very scared and sleep at my girlfriends apartment as often as I can.

My friend and neighbor was brutally and fatally wounded by her longtime boyfriend on thanksgiving at their house.

To logic’s defense, I am in a state of grief. 

She was a sweet girl, only 34-years-old, and was quite the “girly-girl” — so I bought her a bouquet of colorful flowers and a pink candle. 

I am pagan, which is something she admired about me. I did a blessing and wrote her a note (about a paragraph) and I did a blessing to bring her peace, remind her she is loved and through life, I’ll honor her memory. I also said a blessing to neutralize the trauma on the property, so I don’t feel that sense of darkness when I walk by her house. 

Around 7:30 last night, I walk over to her house with the flowers, candle (inside a jar for safety), and a lighter. I brought my dog with me because she invited herself, and I could use the company, because I felt uncomfortable going over there. 

I sit on her empty steps, the house remaining exactly how it was left. I thought I was going to wanna say a few things but once I sat on her step, I felt like I just wanted to light the candle and put the flowers + candle somewhere safe — then get out of there.

It was a quiet night, no winds which was odd, cause a big wind storm is supposed to happen the following day (today). 

Once I walk off her property, I’m just going on a casual walk with my dog. 

As soon as we start walking away from the house, I hear in the faint air, what sounded like a woman’s voice, saying what sounded like “hey”, “hello”, or “help”. It sounded like a very subtle echo that was heard within the air, although there was no wind. 

I barely even heard it, and I probably wouldn’t have paid attention to it, but my dog heard something as well, and she started acting either spooked or confused. She kept turning around to look back at the property and seemed confused. She started doing this immediately after I heard the sound, and she kept looking back till we got a short distance away from the house, then she started acting normal after that, and we went on a normal walk. 

The voice I heard sounded like faint sound traveling in the wind. It sounded like the voice came from the air — and wasn’t a solid, external voice. 

The reason I wasn’t sure exactly what I heard, was because it was more of an echo and I couldn’t hear a complete word spoken — I heard a woman’s voice say “heeeeeeh” and it sounded like she was either saying one of the words I mentioned earlier — “Heeeeeey!” “Hello” or “Help”… 

The voice sounded like it was trailing off in the air, so I only could hear the partial word. 

Immediately my dog turns around, acted confused, while staring back at the house. I even turned and looked back.

I’m 25-year-old woman living a normal good life. It hasn’t always been this way. I grew up in a haunted home. We started living there when I was eight. It’s taken me years to unravel exactly what happened to me in that place. I moved out the moment I could, but it wasn’t until my parents sold the place before I will share what happened. The last time I visited my parents in that house, it relieved me to never set foot in there again. Don’t be mistaken. I have wonderful memories of that place, but they were far and in between. As the youngest child, I strongly believe it targeted me the most. I wasn’t the only one affected by what was happening, yet there was a willing ignorance that solidified my childhood. This is the ugly truth. The things my parents and sibling refuse to discuss. This is an accumulation of over ten years of experiences, so I must split them into multiple post. Beginning to end, everything that happened.

What happened-

The first experience I can remember (bear with me, this was when I was eight, so details I can’t provide) was a horrifying nightmare of a woman concealed by shadows. She would stare at me from my closet between the open doors. I remember her smile and wild eyes. They were terrifying nightmares so bad that I couldn’t stand the dark. The night light helped at first, but then it got worse. I had a nightmare and woke up; my closet doors were cracked with the same eyes staring at me. I ran to the light switch and turned the lights on. The eyes were gone, but the doors were still open. The closet doors had one of those click in doorknobs. My dad checked the knob the next day. It was broken. My dad fixed it. A while later, it would happen again. He would fix the knob while complaining because he fully believed I broke them. This continued until my dad refused to fix the doorknob. Then, I moved extra pillows against the door. It needed to swing to the outside for it to open. I made sure the pillows were snug. That worked, but the nightmares kept happening. Then one night with a disturbing nightmare, I woke up with the doors open and the eyes watching. I rushed to the bedroom door where the light was, but it swung shut. There was a laugh. I felt paralyzed, but then I heard this ‘light’ in my head. The word spoken in a demanding voice, and I quickly tuned in the light. I didn’t get the courage to sleep with a light on in one form or the other again. That’s the next post.

P.S. This is to get what happened off my chest and maybe find people whose experienced similar. Hopefully, this can warn on not ignoring what is happening right Infront of you. I also have got some clarity on what happened, but much is still a mystery to me. I can’t tell you why everything happened, but I can tell you what happened.

After looking and walking in the falling snow in the backyard for about ten minutes, me and my sister I both heard my name being called loudly by my father's voice, and we looked and saw a figure standing right from my room's window overlooking us, that looked like my dad's silhouette. We thought we were we were in trouble since our dad is very strict and overprotective, however, both of us did agree that we also got an eerie feeling at the same time.

We went back into the house and we both went into my room and it was empty, then my sister went into our parent's room and asked our dad about it, and he didn't even know we were outside and that he didn't call my name.
